	Abstract = {This research investigates the effect of armed conflict on adult mortality across                 countries and over time. Theoretical mechanisms are specified for how military                 violence influences adult mortality, both immediately and over time after conflict.                 The effects of aggregate conflict, interstate and intrastate conflicts, and conflict                 severity are explored. The Heckman selection model is applied to account for the                 conflict-induced missing data problem. A pooled analysis across 84 countries for the                 period from 1961 to 1998 provides broad empirical support for the proposed                 theoretical expectations across both genders. This study confirms the importance of                 both the immediate and the lingering effect of military conflict on the mortality of                 the working-age population. The immediate effect of civil conflict is much stronger                 than that of the interstate conflict, while the reverse applies to the lingering                 effect. Both the immediate and the lingering effects of severe conflict are much                 stronger than those of minor conflict. While men tend to suffer higher mortality                 immediately from intrastate conflict and severe conflict, women in the long run                 experience as much mortality owing to the lingering effects of these conflicts. The                 mortality data show a strong data selection bias caused by military conflict. The                 research findings highlight the imperative for negotiating peace. Preventing a                 contest from escalating into a severe conflict can produce noticeable gains in saved                 human lives.},

	Abstract = {When AIDS activists launched their campaign for developing world access to antiretroviral therapy in the late 1990s, this treatment cost on average $10,000 per patient per year. More than a decade later, drug prices for {\textquotedblleft}first line{\textquotedblright} therapies hovered around $100 per patient per year, and nearly 13 million people in low- and middle-income countries were receiving these life-extending medications. By contrast, climate activists during the same time period labored without much success in establishing mechanisms to put a price on carbon. We identify the global market structures most conducive for social movement-led market transformations. We argue that advocacy collective action is more likely to be successful when the global market structure involves (i) a small number of product markets, (ii) globally integrated product markets, (iii) a relatively concentrated industry with few producers or buyers, and (iv) a source of rents produced through social construction rather than natural or technological barriers to entry.},

@article{busby2007a,
	Abstract = {Do states and decision-makers ever act for moral reasons? And if they do, is it only when it is convenient or relatively costless for them to do so? A number of advocacy movements---on developing country debt relief, climate change, landmines, and other issues---emerged in the 1990s to ask decision-makers to make foreign policy decisions on that basis. The primary advocates were motivated not by their own material interests but broader notions of right and wrong. What contributes to the domestic acceptance of these moral commitments? Why do some advocacy efforts succeed where others fail? Through a case study of the Jubilee 2000 campaign for developing country debt relief, this article offers an account of persuasion based on strategic framing by advocates to get the attention of decision-makers. Such strategic but not narrowly self-interested activity allows weak actors to leverage existing value and/or ideational traditions to build broader political coalitions. This article, through case studies of debt relief in the United States and Japan, also links the emerging literature on strategic framing to the domestic institutional context and the ways veto players or ``policy gatekeepers'' evaluate trade-offs between costs and values.},

	Abstract = {Initial sociological interest in network forms of organization was motivated in part by a critique of economic views of organization. Sociologists sought to highlight the prevalence and functionality of organizational forms that could not be classified as markets or hierarchies. As a result of this work, we now know that network forms of organization foster learning, represent a mechanism for the attainment of status or legitimacy, provide a variety of economic benefits, facilitate the management of resource dependencies, and provide considerable autonomy for employees. However, as sociologists move away from critiquing what are now somewhat outdated economic views, they need to balance the exclusive focus on prevalence and functionality with attention to constraint and dysfunctionality. The authors review work that has laid a foundation for this broader focus and suggest analytical concerns that should guide this literature as it moves forward.},

	Abstract = {Laptops are commonplace in university classrooms. In light of cognitive psychology theory on costs associated with multitasking, we examined the effects of in-class laptop use on student learning in a simulated classroom. We found that participants who multitasked on a laptop during a lecture scored lower on a test compared to those who did not multitask, and participants who were in direct view of a multitasking peer scored lower on a test compared to those who were not. The results demonstrate that multitasking on a laptop poses a significant distraction to both users and fellow students and can be detrimental to comprehension of lecture content. },

	Abstract = {Thirty years after the discovery of HIV-1, the early transmission, dissemination, and establishment of the virus in human populations remain unclear. Using statistical approaches applied to HIV-1 sequence data from central Africa, we show that from the 1920s Kinshasa (in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo) was the focus of early transmission and the source of pre-1960 pandemic viruses elsewhere. Location and dating estimates were validated using the earliest HIV-1 archival sample, also from Kinshasa. The epidemic histories of HIV-1 group M and nonpandemic group O were similar until ~1960, after which group M underwent an epidemiological transition and outpaced regional population growth. Our results reconstruct the early dynamics of HIV-1 and emphasize the role of social changes and transport networks in the establishment of this virus in human populations.},

	Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to describe the AIDS epidemic in rural areas of Mexico. Information from the National AIDS Registry and the 1990 XI National Census was used. Rural AIDS cases and urban cases were compared regarding notification time, sex, risk categories and migration information. Of the 19,090 AIDS cases reported to the first of July 1994, 699 (3.7%) were rural cases. The first five of these cases were reported in 1986, three years after the first cases had been reported in Mexico. The number of AIDS cases has been growing each year but in 1991. Cases have been reported by all Mexican states. The state with the highest prevalence was Nayarit with 102 cases per million inhabitants, followed by Morelos with 99, Jalisco with 90, and Colima and Tlaxcala with 84. A total of 25% of the rural cases are migrants who have been to the US, against 6.1% of cases from urban areas. The distribution by sex shows 21.3% of women affected against 14.4% of urban cases (p < 0.05). The rural female to male ratio is 1:4, while the urban ratio is 1:6. The prevalence rates are almost three times greater in men than in women. The rural AIDS pattern represents a problem not because of the number of people affected but because of the heterosexual way of transmission. We do not think that migration to the US is going to change. The rural AIDS epidemic is more recent and growing faster than that occurring in the urban setting.},

	Abstract = {%OBJECTIVE: This paper first presents the trend of HIV/AIDS expenditures in Mexico between 1997 and 2002. It then compares the allocation and magnitude of such expenditures within the international context and, in particular, how other countries in the region are allocating HIV/AIDS resources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 1997, Mexico has developed and been utilizing a method for systematically and comprehensively analyze national resource and expenditure flows for HIV/AIDS prevention and care; an exhaustive study known as the National AIDS Account. Results. During this five year period, a systematic increase in real expenditures occurred (143% increase in total), most of which was allocated to the purchase of drugs for antiretroviral treatment. Nevertheless, compared with other countries in the region, Mexican expenditures for HIV/AIDS are less biased in their allocation between prevention and treatment. DISCUSSION: Mexico is committed to ensure universal coverage of AIDS treatment while maintaining and even increasing prevention efforts. These activities demand increasing amounts of resources. It is, therefore, important to track how efficiently such resources are being used in order to improve allocation and targeting of health resources.},

	Abstract = {This study presents blood-associated AIDS epidemic trends in Mexico, including cases due to blood transfusions, cases in professional blood donors and hemophiliacs. We present also an overview of preventive measures--both legal and educative--undertaken to prevent this type of transmission and its effects on the epidemic. The first blood-associated AIDS cases in Mexico were reported in 1985, since then and up to July 1, 1994 a total of 1,728 adult cases and 116 pediatric cases have been reported (12.3\% and 25\% of the total cases, respectively). As in many other parts in the world, in Mexico women were markedly affected by this form of transmission; the women to men morbidity ratio is 1.35. Another group particularly affected by AIDS in Mexico are professional blood donors, who were infected because of improper management and recycling of blood transfusion centers bank materials such as plasmapheresis sets, in some blood transfusion centers in our country. Blood screening is mandatory for all blood donors in Mexico since May, 1986. A year later blood commercialization was banned because of the extremely high HIV infection prevalences found in some professional blood donors (7.2\%). Since that time a whole set of preventive measures has been implemented in our country, including blood quality and safety control as well as educative interventions. Results of these measures began to become evident by the end of 1991, when newly reported blood associated AIDS cases started to decrease, as opposed to their continuous growth seen in previous years. Up to July 1, 1994 we estimate that a total of 2,750 AIDS cases have been prevented through these measures, recovering an average of 36 years of potential life for each of them. Although blood transmission preventive measures have rendered significant achievements, we still have to face some very complex challenges such as potential ruralization of the epidemic and its impact on HIV infection prevalences among potential blood donors and therefore the need to ensure blood screening in rural areas.},

	Abstract = {"The world is a better place than it used to be. People are wealthier and healthier, and live longer lives. Yet the escapes from destitution by so many have left gaping inequalities between people and between nations. In The Great Escape, Angus Deaton--one of the foremost experts on economic development and on poverty--tells the remarkable story of how, starting two hundred and fifty years ago, some parts of the world began to experience sustained progress, opening up gaps and setting the stage for today's hugely unequal world. Deaton takes an in-depth look at the historical and ongoing patterns behind the health and wealth of nations, and he addresses what needs to be done to help those left behind.    Deaton describes vast innovations and wrenching setbacks: the successes of antibiotics, pest control, vaccinations, and clean water on the one hand, and disastrous famines and the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the other. He examines the United States, a nation that has prospered but is today experiencing slower growth and increasing inequality. He also considers how economic growth in India and China has improved the lives of more than a billion people. Deaton argues that international aid has been ineffective and even harmful. He suggests alternative efforts--including reforming incentives to drug companies and lifting trade restrictions--that will allow the developing world to bring about its own Great Escape.    Demonstrating how changes in health and living standards have transformed our lives, The Great Escape is a powerful guide to addressing the well-being of all nations"--Publisher description},

	Abstract = {Upon what kind of moral order does capitalism rest? Conversely, does the market give rise to a distinctive set of beliefs, habits, and social bonds? These questions are certainly as old as social science itself. In this review, we evaluate how today's scholarship approaches the relationship between markets and the moral order. We begin with Hirschman's characterization of the three rival views of the market as civilizing, destructive, or feeble in its effects on society. We review recent work at the intersection of sociology, economics, and political economy and show that these views persist both as theories of market society and moral arguments about it. We then argue that a fourth view, which we call moralized markets, has become increasingly prominent in economic sociology. This line of research sees markets as cultural phenomena and moral projects in their own right, and seeks to study the mechanisms and techniques by which such projects are realized in practice.},

	Annote = {Why were AIDS activists successful in putting universal access to treatment on the international agenda when so many other global campaigns have either failed or struggled to have much impact? We focus on: (1) permissive material conditions; (2) convergence on a policy prescription; (3) attributes of the activists; and (4) the broad political support for their cause. In our view, the market for antiretroviral (ARV) drugs was politically constructed; activists had to bring the demand and supply sides of the market together through a variety of tactics and strategies. The idea that motivated the activists was that ARVs should ideally be `merit goods', goods that are available to everyone regardless of income. But, when ARVs first came on the market, poor people in the developing world lacked the resources to buy them. Activists successfully lobbied donor nations to use foreign aid to buy ARVs, and they pressured pharmaceutical companies to lower their prices, while encouraging generic firms to enter the market. However, even where a policy enjoys favorable material conditions -- i.e. low costs, large benefits, demonstrated feasibility -- this may not be enough. A clear prescription, credible messengers and resonant arguments may be necessary for an issue to receive adequate political support.

Policy Implications

-Global activists are playing an increasingly important role in world politics, but global activism influences policy outcomes only under certain conditions. 
-Global activists can only succeed when they couple compelling moral arguments with permissive material conditions. 
-Global activists need to build broad coalitions in order to be politically successful. 
-Despite the success of the access to treatment regime, questions remain about its sustainability in light of the great recession that began in 2008, donor fatigue regarding AIDS and the emergence of other policy priorities in the foreign aid community.},

@article{altmanbuse2012a,
	Abstract = { AIDS has a uniquely political history. Its early association with stigmatised homosexual behaviour and more liberating gay identity activism set the precedent for highly effective mobilisation. The results were unparalleled in global health. AIDS was briefly treated as high politics and attracted increased funds to achieve the ambitious goal of universal access to HIV prevention and treatment. If AIDS is to maintain its visibility and contribution to global solidarity, human rights and dignity, its politics must evolve to reflect the profound geo-political, economic and social transformations currently underway. `Thinking politically about HIV', an initiative of UNAIDS and the International AIDS Society, was convened in recognition of the need to better understand these politics and consider how the political sciences can further engage. This paper, and the edited volume it introduces, provides some insights into the Thinking Politically discussions as well as the wider scholarship on the challenges facing the AIDS response. The authors argue that while mainstream political science has largely ignored the epidemic, other disciplines and traditions provide rich accounts of the exceptional response. Given the changing context, the authors present an agenda of practically oriented, politically informed research to identify the levers that can be used to maintain the viability of the response. },

	Abstract = {Many social scientists believe that dumping long lists of explanatory variables into lin- ear regression, probit, logit, and other statistical equations will successfully ``control'' for the effects of auxiliary factors. Encouraged by convenient software and ever more powerful computing, researchers also believe that this conventional approach gives the true explanatory variables the best chance to emerge. The present paper argues that these beliefs are false, and that without intensive data analysis, linear regression mod- els are likely to be inaccurate. Instead, a quite different and less mechanical research methodology is needed, one that integrates contemporary powerful statistical meth- ods with deep substantive knowledge and classic data--analytic techniques of creative engagement with the data.	},

	Abstract = {<sec><title>Background</title><p>Generalized heterosexual epidemics are responsible for the largest share of the global burden of HIV. These occur in populations that do not have high rates of partner acquisition, and research suggests that a pattern of fewer, but concurrent, partnerships may be the mechanism that provides the connectivity necessary for sustained transmission. We examine how network size affects the impact of concurrency on network connectivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We use a stochastic network model to generate a sample of networks, varying the size of the network and the level of concurrency, and compare the largest components for each scenario to the asymptotic expected values. While the threshold for the growth of a giant component does not change, the transition is more gradual in the smaller networks. As a result, low levels of concurrency generate more connectivity in small networks.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Generalized HIV epidemics are by definition those that spread to a larger fraction of the population, but the mechanism may rely in part on the dynamics of transmission in a set of linked small networks. Examples include rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa and segregated minority populations in the US, where the effective size of the sexual network may well be in the hundreds, rather than thousands. Connectivity emerges at lower levels of concurrency in smaller networks, but these networks can still be disconnected with small changes in behavior. Concurrency remains a strategic target for HIV combination prevention programs in this context.</p></sec>},

@book{jackson2011a,
	Abstract = {There are many different scientifically valid ways to produce knowledge. The field of International Relations should pay closer attention to these methodological differences, and to their implications for concrete research on world politics.

The Conduct of Inquiry in International Relations provides an introduction to the philosophy of science issues and their implications for the study of global politics. The author draws attention to the problems caused by the misleading notion of a single unified scientific method, and proposes a framework that clarifies the variety of ways that IR scholars establish the authority and validity of their empirical claims. Jackson connects philosophical considerations with concrete issues of research design within neopositivist, critical realist, analyticist, and reflexive approaches to the study of world politics. Envisioning a pluralist science for a global IR field, this volume organizes the significant differences between methodological stances so as to promote internal consistency, public discussion, and worldly insight as the hallmarks of any scientific study of world politics.

@book{walker1993a,
	Address = {Cambridge},
	Annote = {In this book Rob Walker offers an original analysis of the relationship between twentieth-century theories of international relations, and the political theory of civil society since the early modern period. He views theories of international relations both as an ideological expression of the modern state, and as a clear indication of the difficulties of thinking about a world politics characterized by profound spatiotemporal accelerations. International relations theories should be seen, the author argues, more as aspects of contemporary world politics than as explanations of contemporary world politics. These theories are examined in the light of recent debates about modernity and post-modernity, sovereignty and political identity, and the limits of modern social and political theory. This book is a major contribution to the field of critical international relations, and will be of interest to social and political theorists and political scientists, as well as students and scholars of international relations.

He has long placed the environment at the head of his church's agenda, earning him numerous awards and the title `Green Patriarch'. This paper describes the work of Patriarch Bartholomew for the protection of the natural environment, and especially for significant water bodies of the planet. This work has been done first in his own church, and subse- quently in the wider society through international, inter-religious, and interdisciplinary gatherings that have gained the attention of policymakers and the mass media. The paper contains various insights into the Orthodox Christian worldview that direct the vision and activities of the Patriarch.},

We address this question by studying whether firms in which the Turkish mil- itary had a controlling financial interest earned abnormally high stock returns on the Istanbul stock exchange. Our findings from event studies are that this is indeed the case. We infer that militaries can retain substantial power to influence economic policy from behind the scenes even after formally transferring it to democratically elected leaders.

@article{smith2002a,
	Abstract = {Responses to emergencies caused by conflict or natural disasters are typically confined to addressing basic needs such as food, shelter and fuel, water and sanitation and immediate health provision through disease treatment or prevention. Less well-recognised, however, is the relevance of HIV at the planning and initial stages of emergency response.

This paper argues that emergency practitioners need a better understanding of the links between emergencies and vulnerability to HIV. It illustrates how HIV-related considerations need to be taken into account from the earliest point of response to an emergency and through every stage of involvement. The paper stresses that HIV-related considerations need to go beyond a narrowly medical or even general health-care focus, and calls for a concerted multi-sectoral approach to ensure that the diverse and complex issues raised by HIV in emergency situations are addressed. The paper identifies key considerations that need to be taken into account, and invites humanitarian agencies to review their policies and practices, and implement any changes needed in the light of the issues identified.},

Our study covers four types of indicators: urban air pollution, the state of the oxygen regime in river basins, fecal contamination of river basins, and contamination of river basins by heavy metals. We find no evidence that environmental quality deteriorates steadily with economic growth. Rather, for most indicators, economic growth brings an initial phase of deterioration followed by a subsequent phase of improvement. The turning points for the different pollutants vary, but in most cases they come before a country reaches a per capita income of $8000.},

	Abstract = {The dramatic and sometimes heartbreaking story of families striving toward a better life in one of the twenty-first century's great, unequal cities. In this fast-paced book, based on three years of uncompromising reporting, a bewildering age of global change and inequality is made human. Annawadi is a makeshift settlement in the shadow of luxury hotels near the Mumbai airport, and as India starts to prosper, Annawadians are electric with hope. Abdul, a reflective and enterprising Muslim teenager, sees fortune in the recyclable garbage of richer people. Asha, a woman of formidable wit and deep scars from a rural childhood, has identified an alternate route to the middle class: political corruption. And even the poorest Annawadians, like Kalu, a fifteen-year-old scrap-metal thief, believe themselves inching closer to good times. But then, as the tenderest individual hopes intersect with the greatest global truths, the true contours of a competitive age are revealed.--From publisher description},

	Abstract = {Empirical analyses in political science very commonly confront data that are grouped---multiple votes by individual legislators, multiple years in individual states, multiple conflicts during individual years, and so forth. Modeling these data presents a series of potential challenges, of which accounting for differences across the groups is perhaps the most well-known. Two widely-used methods are the use of either "fixed" or "random" effects models. However, how best to choose between these approaches remains unclear in the applied literature. We employ a series of simulation experiments to evaluate the relative performance of fixed and random effects estimators for varying types of datasets. We further investigate the commonly-used Hausman test, and demonstrate that it is neither a necessary nor sufficient statistic for deciding between fixed and random effects. We summarize the results into a typology of datasets to offer practical guidance to the applied researcher.	},

	Abstract = {"Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the world's poor. But much of the work they do is based on assumptions that are untested generalizations at best, flat out harmful misperceptions at worst. Banerjee and Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials in development economics. Work based on these principles, supervised by the Poverty Action Lab at MIT, is being carried out in dozens of countries. Their work transforms certain presumptions: that microfinance is a cure-all, that schooling equals learning, that poverty at the level of 99 cents a day is just a more extreme version of the experience any of us have when our income falls uncomfortably low. Throughout, the authors emphasize that life for the poor is simply not like life for everyone else: it is a much more perilous adventure, denied many of the cushions and advantages that are routinely provided to the more affluent"--},

Without denying the potentially serious implications of such an outbreak, I question the usefulness of securitizing avian flu. I begin by reviewing how scholars and policymakers have securitized avian flu before outlining three main objections: that securitization encourages inappropriate responses, that it diverts attention from other pressing public health concerns, and that it furthers the gap between the First and Third Worlds. },

@article{youde2009a,
	Abstract = {The AIDS epidemic has exacted a terrible toll on the African continent, but little research has examined how Africans themselves feel about their governments' responses to this health crisis. Using Afrobarometer survey data from 15 different sub-Saharan African states collected between 2002 and 2004, I examine the factors that lead to higher support for an individual government's AIDS control efforts. The results suggest that, in some instances, support for a government's AIDS policies may simply be a proxy for more generalized support for the government. They also suggest that governments that can demonstrate competency in one area (like economic management) may have more leeway from the public to address an issue like AIDS. While HIV/AIDS certainly still carries a stigma in certain communities throughout the continent, the survey results may suggest that AIDS policies are, for better or worse, entering the realm of 'normal' politics.},

	Abstract = {The international community appears to have embraced a new norm --- that of universal access to antiretroviral drugs. The process by which this norm has found acceptance raises interesting questions about how norm entrepreneurs frame their arguments, the role of non-state actors in realizing a norm, and the importance of existent complementary norms. To understand the success of the norm of universal antiretroviral access, I examine the failure of an earlier health-related norm --- that of universal primary health care. The campaign for universal antiretroviral access points to a need for a more nuanced understanding of norm evolution within the international community and a more holistic vision of which actors can facilitate the realization of a norm.},

	Abstract = {While analysts have focused largely on the role  of political will to  explain a government's 
willingness to implement effective AIDS policies, little research has explored the origins of that 
political will. I argue that, through a consideration of the ideological outlook of government 
officials, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of political will and the desire to 
implement certain types of policies. To demonstrate the importance of ideology, I examine two 
cases of national AIDS policies: Uganda, widely hailed for its pro-active response to the AIDS 
epidemic, and South Africa, largely  vilified for its courting of AIDS dissidents. This research 
shows the importance of going  beyond simple examinations of  state capacity to reflect the 
underlying belief structures that make possible (or impossible) certain policy actions. },

The author analyses and groups the extant research into four research programmes.

	Abstract = {Pathologies of Power uses harrowing stories of life--and death--in extreme situations to interrogate our understanding of human rights. Paul Farmer, a physician and anthropologist with twenty years of experience working in Haiti, Peru, and Russia, argues that promoting the social and economic rights of the world's poor is the most important human rights struggle of our times. With passionate eyewitness accounts from the prisons of Russia and the beleaguered villages of Haiti and Chiapas, this book links the lived experiences of individual victims to a broader analysis of structural violence. Farmer challenges conventional thinking within human rights circles and exposes the relationships between political and economic injustice, on one hand, and the suffering and illness of the powerless, on the other. Farmer shows that the same social forces that give rise to epidemic diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis also sculpt risk for human rights violations. He illustrates the ways that racism and gender inequality in the United States are embodied as disease and death. Yet this book is far from a hopeless inventory of abuse. Farmer's disturbing examples are linked to a guarded optimism that new medical and social technologies will develop in tandem with a more informed sense of social justice. Otherwise, he concludes, we will be guilty of managing social inequality rather than addressing structural violence. Farmer's urgent plea to think about human rights in the context of global public health and to consider critical issues of quality and access for the world's poor should be of fundamental concern to a world characterized by the bizarre proximity of surfeit and suffering},

	Abstract = {This article examines four accepted wisdoms about HIV/AIDS and African armies and in each case concludes that substantial revision is necessary in the light of emerging evidence. First, it appears that military populations do not necessarily have a higher prevalence of HIV than civilian populations. HIV levels in armies depend on many factors including the demographics of the army, its pattern of deployment, the nature and stage of the epidemic in the country concerned, and the measures taken to control the disease by the military authorities. Second, although the epidemic has the potential to undermine the functioning of national militaries, and may have done so in isolated instances, armies in general are well placed to withstand the threat. Third, evidence that war contributes to the spread of the virus is meagre and suggests that we should be concerned primarily with specific risks that conflict may entail including population mobility and changing sexual networks. Lastly, the hypothesis that AIDS has the potential to disrupt national, regional, and international security remains speculative.},

	Abstract = {Objectives: To study prevalence and incidence of HIV-1andHIV-2 between 1990 and 2007 and to examine impact of the civil war in 1998--1999. We also wanted to investigate possible interaction between HIV-1 and HIV-2.

Design: Open prospective cohort study of 4592 police officers in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa.

Methods: Analysis of HIV-1 and HIV-2 prevalence and incidence divided in 2--3 years time strata.

Results: HIV-1 prevalence (including HIV-1/HIV-2 dual reactivity) increased gradually from 0.6 to 3.6% before the war and was 9.5% in the first serosurvey after the war. HIV-1 incidence more than doubled during and shortly after the war, from 0.50 to 1.22 per 100 person-years. Both prevalence and incidence of HIV-1 decreased in the following periods after the war. HIV-2 prevalence decreased from 13.4 to 6.2% during the entire study period and HIV-2 incidence decreased from 1.38 to 0.18 per 100 person-years. Adjusted incidence rate ratios of HIV-1 incidence in HIV-2-positive participants compared with HIV-negative participants ranged from 1.02 to 1.18 (not significant) depending on the confounding variables included.

Conclusion: HIV-1 has increased, whereas HIV-2 has decreased and the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is now more than four times higher as compared with HIV-2. The civil war in 1998--1999 appears to have induced a temporary increase in HIV-1 transmission, but now a stabilization of HIV-1 incidence and prevalence seems to have taken place. There was no evidence of a protective effect of HIV-2 against HIV-1},

@article{superviehalima2010a,
	Abstract = {Objectives: To quantify the potential impact of mass rape on HIV incidence in seven conflict-afflicted countries (CACs), with severe HIV epidemics, in sub-Saharan Africa.

Design: Uncertainty analysis of a risk equation model.

Methods: A mathematical model was used to evaluate the potential impact of mass rape on increasing HIV incidence in women and girls in Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, southern Sudan and Uganda. The model was parameterized with data from UNAIDS/WHO and the US Census Bureau's International Database. Incidence data from UNAIDS/WHO were used for calibration.

Results: Mass rape could cause approximately five HIV infections per 100 000 females per year in the DRC, Sudan, Somalia and Sierra Leone, double the number in Burundi and Rwanda, and quadruple the number in Uganda. The number of females infected per year due to mass rape is likely to be relatively low in Somalia and Sierra Leone at 127 [median (interquartile range [IQR] 55--254)] and 156 [median (IQR 69--305)], respectively. Numbers could be high in the DRC and Uganda: 1120 [median (IQR 527--2360)] and 2172 [median (IQR 1031--4668)], respectively. In Burundi, Rwanda and Sudan, the numbers are likely to be intermediate. Under extreme conditions, 10 000 women and girls could be infected per year in the DRC and 20 000 women and girls could be infected per year in Uganda. Mass rape could increase annual incidence by approximately 7% [median (IQR 3--15)].

Conclusion: Interventions and treatment targeted to rape survivors during armed conflicts could reduce HIV incidence. Support should be provided both on the basis of human rights and public health.},

An inventory of published articles in the \emph{Revue Fran{\c c}aise de Science Politique} and \emph{Politix} since 1970 has provided information on methodological preferences and sub-field coverage, thus allowing for meaningful comparisons with trends in American political science. This essay identifies the scholarly output of the teaching and research institutions of French political science and examines the methodological requirements of the graduate programs of political science departments in France.},

@article{aginam2010a,
	Abstract = {Intellectual property ``rights,'' in many complex ways, impede access to Anti- Retroviral (ARV) drugs in most developing countries with heavy burdens of AIDS-related mortality and morbidity. This article argues that developing countries that lack the necessary pharmaceutical capacity should exploit emerging opportunities for South-South cooperation. While countries like Brazil and India have produced generic ARV drugs, most developing countries either do not have the technology to do so or they are ``pressured'' against doing so because of the consequences of violation of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) enforced by the Word Trade Organization. Most recently, Uganda entered into an agreement with Cipla, an Indian generic manufacturer of ARV drugs to open a drug plant in Uganda. Because such opportunities for South-South cooperation abound in contemporary global AIDS diplomacy, developing countries should ingeniously exploit them in ways that do not violate TRIPS. The impediments to this framework would include circumventing the hurdles posed by TRIPS as well as the pressure by global pharmaceutical corporate giants against such initiatives.},

@article{beckmannbujra2010a,
	Abstract = {Starting from a body of literature on movements around `biological citizen- ship', this article analyses the political significance of HIV-positive people's collective action in Tanzania. We explore reasons for the limited impact of Tanzanian AIDS activism on the wider political scene, concluding that the formation of a `movement' is still in its infancy and faces many constraints, though some breakthroughs have been made. Participation in PLHA groups in Tanzania encourages politicizing struggles over representation, demo- cratic forms and gender that can lead to a process of political socialization in which members learn to recognize and confront abuses of power. It is in such low-level, less visible social transformations that the greatest potential of participation in collective action around HIV/AIDS in Tanzania lies.},

	Abstract = {Background: Drawing on policy theories, an assessment was made of the perceived political feasibility of scaling-up five evidence-based interventions to curb Pakistan's HIV epidemic: needle and syringe exchange programmes; targeted behaviour change communication; sexual health care for male and transgender sex workers; sexual and reproductive health care for female sex workers; and promoting and protecting the rights of those at greatest risk.

Method: A questionnaire was emailed to 40 stakeholders and completed by 22. They expressed their level of agreement with 15 statements for each intervention (related to variables associated with policy success). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 respondents.

Results: The interventions represent considerable change from the status quo, but are perceived to respond to widely acknowledged problems. These perceptions, held by the HIV policy elite, need to be set in the context of the prevailing view that the AIDS response is not warranted given the small and concentrated nature of the epidemic and that the interventions do not resonate closely with values held by society. The interventions were perceived to be evidence-based, supported by at least one donor and subject to little resistance from frontline staff as they will be implemented by contracted non-government organisations. The results were mixed in terms of other factors determining political feasibility, including the extent to which interventions are easy to explain, exhibit simple technical features, require few additional funds, are supported and not opposed by powerful stakeholders.

Conclusion: The interventions stand a good chance of being implemented although they depend on donor support. The prospects for scaling them would be improved by ongoing policy analysis and strengthening of domestic constituencies among the target groups.},

	Abstract = {This article aims to explain South Africa's controversial post-1994 HIV/AIDS policy. It isolates two competing sets of policy prescriptions: a `mobilization/biomedical' paradigm that emphasized societal mobilization, political leadership and anti-retroviral treatments; and a `nationalist/ameliorative' paradigm that focused on poverty, palliative care, traditional medicine, and appropriate nutrition. It explains the ascendancy of the ameliorative paradigm in terms of its administrative and political viability in South African conditions. It explores how public sector institutions circumscribed the viability of biomedical interventions, while political institutions and state-society relations reduced knowledge transfer and policy learning. It then investigates the intellectual context that shaped the political viability of each paradigm. Finally it argues that the ANC accommodated proponents of each policy paradigm, and that instrumental calculation of the dangers of an inequitable and unsustainable anti-retroviral programme best explains the government's continued adherence to a cautious prevention and treatment policy.},

@article{dewaal2010a,
	Abstract = {This paper draws upon the findings of the AIDS, Security and Conflict Initiative (ASCI) to reach conclu- sions about the relationship between HIV/AIDS, security, conflict and governance, in the areas of HIV/ AIDS and state fragility, the reciprocal interactions between armed conflicts (including post-conflict transitions) and HIV/AIDS, and the impact of HIV/AIDS on uniformed services and their operational effectiveness. Gender issues cut across all elements of the research agenda. ASCI commissioned 29 research projects across regions, disciplines and communities of practice.

Over the last decade, approaches to HIV/AIDS as a security threat have altered dramatically, from the early anticipation that the epidemic posed a threat to the basic functioning of states and security institutions, to a more sanguine assessment that the impacts will be less severe than feared. ASCI finds that governance outcomes have been shaped as much by the perception of HIV/AIDS as a security threat, as the actual impacts of the epidemic.

ASCI research found that the current indices of fragility at country level did not demonstrate any significant association with HIV, calling into question the models used for asserting such linkages. However at local government level, appreciable impacts can be seen. Evidence from ASCI and elsewhere indicates that conventional indicators of conflict, including the definition of when it ends, fail to capture the social traumas associated with violent disruption and their implications for HIV. Policy frameworks adopted for political and security reasons translate poorly into social and public health policies. Fears of much-elevated HIV rates among soldiers with disastrous impacts on armies as institutions, have been overstated. In mature epidemics, rates of infection among the military resemble those of the peer groups within the general population. Military HIV/AIDS control policies follow a different and parallel paradigm to national (civilian) policies, in which armies prioritize command responsibility and operational effectiveness over individual rights. Law enforcement practices regarding criminalized and stigmatized activities, such as injecting drug use and commercial sex work, are an important factor in shaping the trajectory of HIV epidemics.},

	Abstract = {A comparison of HIV/AIDS policies in Botswana and Uganda is revealing. It helps to highlight the kinds of policies that are necessary to come to terms with the pandemic in Africa, where it is already a public health disaster. It is argued that the promotion of condoms at an early stage proved to be counter-productive in Botswana, whereas the lack of condom promotion during the 1980s and early 1990s contributed to the relative success of behaviour change strategies in Uganda. Other important factors included national and local- level leadership, the engagement (or alienation) of religious groups and local healers and, most controversially, procedures of social compliance. We end with a call for more draconian measures than are currently envisaged.},

It does this by looking at the cultural and institutional features that have created resistance to the message and inhibited effective implementation. The negative response to the first educational campaign stressing condom use is described and contextualized in terms of Tswana ideas of morality and illness. Nor, as was initially expected, did the introduction of free ARV therapy operate to break the silence and stigma that had developed around the disease. Take-up was very slow, and did not operate to encourage widespread testing. In 2003, key policymakers in Botswana began to argue for a break with the AIDS 'exceptionalism' position, with its emphasis on voluntarism, confidentiality and the human rights of patients. This resulted in routine testing being introduced in 2004. This links to a major argument running through the paper which is that the failure of policy cannot be attributed solely to the nature of local populations. Western cultural assumptions about 'good practice' also require critical examination.},

	Abstract = {This article summarizes the experience and results of a campaign for access to medicines for HIV in South Africa, led by the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) between 1998 and 2008. It illustrates how the TAC mobilized people to campaign for the right to health using a combination of human rights education, HIV treatment literacy, demonstration, and litigation. As a result of these campaigns, the TAC was able to reduce the price of medicines, prevent hundreds of thousands of HIV- related deaths, but also to force significant additional resources into the health system and towards the poor. The article asks whether the method of the TAC has a wider application for human rights campaigns and, particularly, whether the protection of the right to health in law, and the obligation that it be progressively realized by the State, provides an opportunity to advance human rights practice.},

	Abstract = {Despite an extensive empirical literature, there is little agreement on how and why political regimes affect social and economic development. Rather than examining the effect of political regimes on broad social outcomes, this paper examines how political regimes affect specific health policies relating to the treatment of HIV/AIDS -- one of the most widespread and deadly epidemics of modern time. Drawing on arguments from political economy, the paper assesses whether political regimes -- democracy and dictatorship -- matter for access to treatment of HIV/AIDS. Using regression and matching methods on data for a broad cross-section of countries, the results show that democracy increases access to treatment of HIV/AIDS. For developing countries alone, the effect of democracy remains positive, but the significance and magnitude of the effect diminishes somewhat. This suggests that we should be careful about attributing too much importance to the role of political regimes in the battle against HIV/AIDS.},

	Abstract = {Conclusion: The use of selective evidence as the basis for policy recommendations can be misleading and counter- productive. Countries with HIV-1 prevalence rates of more than 30% (such as some in Southern Africa) would be wrong to assume that by simply copying a few obvious Ugandan government interventions, they can expect to see a two-thirds reduction in their HIV-1 prevalence rate. Although Uganda has indeed done much in its struggle against HIV/AIDS, and the Ugandan experience can provide valuable information to assist other nations in their prevention efforts, inappropriate recom- mendations based on poor interpretation of evidence must not be used as the basis for policy.},

	Abstract = {This article examines the political dimensions of Uganda's progress in bringing a generalised HIV/AIDS epidemic under con- trol. The article documents the history of the political processes involved in Uganda's battle against HIV/AIDS and analyses the complexities of presidential action and the relation between action at the level of the state and that taken within societal orga- nisations. By the mid-1980s, Uganda was experiencing a full-blown epidemic, the virulence of which was connected with social dislocation and insecurity related to economic crisis and war. Political authorities faced the same challenge as other regimes experiencing the onslaught of AIDS in Africa. The epidemiological characteristics of HIV and AIDS --- transmission through heterosexual activities, with a long gestation period, affecting people in the prime of their productive life---meant that action required wide-reaching changes in sexual behaviour, and the educational activities to achieve this, as well as relatively complex systems to monitor the virus and control medical practices (blood supplies, injection practices, mitigating drug delivery). The centralist character of the Museveni regime was crucial not only to mobilising state organisations and foreign aid resources, but also to ensuring significant involvement from non-state associations and religious authorities. The Ugandan experience demon- strates that there is a tension between the requirements for systematic action that a strong public authority can deliver and the need to disseminate information requiring a degree of democratic openness. The President was able to forge a coalition behind an HIV/AIDS campaign in part because the virus largely ignored the privileges of wealth and political power. With the devel- opment of antiretroviral therapy and the access that the wealthy can gain to these drugs, this basis for the broadest possible coalition to fight HIV/AIDS may be weakened in the future. },

	Abstract = {This article examines the response of the international community to the HIV/ AIDS crisis, focusing on efforts to promote a `multisectoral' approach to fighting the epidemic. It critically assesses the evolution of an `organizational template', which requires developing country governments to establish stand-alone National AIDS Commissions in order to receive funding for HIV/AIDS programmes. While the World Bank, based on interpretations generated by the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and bilateral donors, claims that the model is derived from successful experience, an examination of evidence particularly from Uganda, Senegal and Malawi, suggests that National Commissions have not worked well and may, in fact, have contributed to weakening health sectors attempting to cope with the crisis.},

	Abstract = {Amidst the AIDS epidemic that is causing such destruction in Sub-Saharan Africa, two countries stand out for their progress in battling HIV -- Senegal and Uganda. The two `success stories' represent very different kinds of success-- that is, one where early intervention kept HIV/AIDS under control and the other where concerted action in the context of a full-blown epidemic has seen early signs of stabilisation and even reduction of prevalence and incidence of the virus. This chapter examines the recent history of the fight against AIDS in both countries and suggests that central state action has been pivotal to the progress achieved to date.

The first two sections of the chapter examine contrasting patterns of the epidemic in the two countries and the gains made in fighting the virus. Section three explains the reasons why political leaders at the highest level of the state in both countries engaged early in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The fourth section examines the relationship between the state and societal actors, particularly religious groups and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in launching the fight against HIV/AIDS. In the final section, I reflect on the lessons from these two `success stories' in relation to the prescriptions for fighting the virus currently being promoted on the international stage.},

@article{rushton2010b,
	Abstract = {Two assumptions underpin much of the literature that has examined the links between HIV/AIDS and security: (1) that HIV/AIDS is now firmly established as an international security issue; and (2) that Resolution 1308, adopted by the UN Security Council in July 2000, was the decisive moment in the securitization process. This article questions both of those assumptions. It argues that even within the Security Council, HIV/AIDS' status as a bona fide threat to international peace and security is not entirely secure. Despite the fact that the Resolution was adopted unanimously, there is considerable doubt over the extent to which the Council members were persuaded that HIV/AIDS is genuinely a threat to international peace and security. Furthermore, the Council's subsequent actions suggest a retreat from the issue. The article moves on to examine statements made in and by some of the other key UN System bodies grappling with HIV/AIDS. Focusing in particular on the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and UNAIDS, it is argued that the international security framing of HIV/AIDS has not generally achieved a great deal of traction within these bodies. Alternative framings, in particular international development and human rights, occur far more frequently. This raises issues for our understanding of both securitization theory and the global governance of HIV/AIDS.},

@article{rushton2010a,
	Abstract = {What determines whether or not global health problems become global political priorities? In recent years the global health governance literature, drawing on earlier constructivist work on `framing,' has begun to examine precisely these issues and to develop more nuanced explanations of prioritization in global health. This paper takes those explanations and supplements them with the work of the Copenhagen School which argues that `securitization' offers a means of lifting issues above `mere politics,' generating political priority in the process. Through an analysis of four of the key global statements around HIV and AIDS (the health issue which has been most widely prioritized) over the past decade, the paper identifies evidence of three of the most prominent framings of the AIDS problem: namely AIDS as a development issue, as a human rights issue, and as a security threat. It finds that the development frame is by far the most prominent in these documents, that the security frame is deployed surprisingly infrequently, and that the human rights frame occurs largely in the context of the modality of response rather than being presented as a reason for prioritization per se. These findings allow for the existing explanations of prioritization to be supplemented and some additional insights to be drawn on the importance of agency, ideas, political context, and the characteristics of the issue itself. The paper finishes by looking ahead, suggesting appropriate strategies for AIDS advocates to employ in the current political context of global health and development.},

@article{schneiderstein2001a,
	Abstract = {In common with the rest of the Southern African sub-continent, South Africa is currently experiencing a serious HIV epidemic. When it came into power in 1994, the new, Mandela-led government immediately mobilised funds and adopted a far-reaching AIDS Plan for the country. However, the implementation of AIDS policy in the first four years after 1994 has been characterised by a lack of progress and a breakdown of trust and co-operation, both within government and between government and NGOs. This paper outlines the political context which shaped the development of the AIDS Policy, then examines the difficulties of implementing a comprehensive response to AIDS in a country undergoing restructuring at every level. It questions the notion of ``inadequate political will'' as an explanation for lack of progress. Involvement by politicians has, in fact, been experienced as a double-edged sword in South Africa, with inappropriate, ``quick-fix'' actions creating conflict and hampering a more longer-term, effective response. The paper also highlights the importance of groupings outside of government in promoting effective policy actions, and the types of leadership required to mobilise a broad range of actors around a common vision. It concludes by emphasising the need to develop approaches to policy implementation rooted in the possibilities and constraints of the local situation, rather than relying on universal blue-prints developed out of context. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	Abstract = {Though `democratic AIDS governance' has become the norm for the political governance of the AIDS response, it presents a dilemma that is likely to undermine the effectiveness and political sustainability of the response. By showing the kind of political leadership that would strengthen the HIV prevention agenda in Eastern and Southern Africa, elected politicians become vulnerable to the political populism that feeds on discrimination and denial in society, to the detriment of the AIDS response. We need to better understand how this governance dilemma plays out in different contexts and develop ideas for how to structure political incentives so that championing AIDS becomes a sustainable strategy to win and uphold political power.},

	Abstract = {Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is difficult in poor settings. In 2001, the Thai government adopted the policy to scale-up its treatment initiative to meet the needs of all its people. Employing qualitative approaches, including in-depth interviews, document review and direct observation, this study examines the processes by which the universal ART policy developed between 2001 and 2007, with the focus on the connections between actors who shared common interests---so-called policy networks. Research findings illustrate the crucial contributions of non-state networks in the policy process. The supportive roles of public-civic networks could be observed at every policy stage, and at different levels of the health sector. Although this particular health policy may be unique in case and setting, it does suggest clearly that while the state dominated the policy process initially, non-state actors played extremely important roles. Their contribution was not simply at agenda-setting stages---for example by lobbying government---but in the actual development and implementation of health policy. Further it illustrates that these processes were dynamic, took place over long periods and were not limited to national borders, but extended beyond, to include global actors and processes.},

	Abstract = {It has been widely speculated that violent conflict acts as a key contributor to the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Yet to date no empirical examination of the conflict-HIV relationship has been conducted. Drawing on work in political science and public health, we set forth a theoretical framework for understanding this potential relationship and go on to present data on the spatio-temporal dispersion of HIV/AIDS in 43 African countries during the period from 1997 to 2005. We then assess the association between domestic and international conflict and levels of HIV/AIDS infection while controlling for a range of other influential factors. Our analyses support a clear positive relationship between both international and domestic conflict and climbing HIV/AIDS prevalence, as well as significant palliative effects for education and economic development on the incidence of HIV/AIDS.},

Considers the history of the epidemic in African context, regional differences in the ways the epidemic has manifested, and understanding the epidemic in social terms. The social terms covered are: gender vulnerabilities, sexuality, and poverty/migration/war.

Notes that biomedical paradigms remain dominant, primarily because that's where the funding is. And while plenty of biomedical scientists know about and understand the ``social embeddedness'' of identity, vulnerability, sexual expression, and so forth, funding favors ``scientifically based'' epidemiological studies. ``Unfortunately, most national AIDS prevention programs are designed according to these biomedical models of individual risk and rational behavior change, and their lack of success in intervening into the epidemic is evident'' (4).

Not a single contributor to the volume has training as a political scientist; there are a multitude of geographers, sociologists, (soft) demographers, and anthropologists.

	Abstract = {This paper provides an empirical evaluation of adult HIV prevalence rates, foreign aid for HIV/AIDS programmes, and the amount of government spending on health care. It finds that there exists a statistically significant relationship between adult HIV prevalence rates and the amount of foreign funding for HIV/AIDS programmes, suggesting that need does in fact play some role in the allocation of HIV aid. It suggests there may be an additive relationship between foreign and domestic health spending, where governments turn the funding of their AIDS programmes over to foreign donors and instead put their own monies toward other parts of the health care system.},

	Abstract = {Global health analysts have debated whether donor prioritization of HIV/AIDS control has lifted all boats, raising attention and funding levels for health issues aside from HIV/AIDS. We investigate this question, considering donor funding for 4 historically prominent health agendas-HIV/AIDS, health systems strengthening, population and reproductive health, and infectious disease control-over the decade 1998-2007. We employ funding data from the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which tracks donor aid. The data indicate that HIV/AIDS may have helped to increase funding for the control of other infectious diseases; however, there is no firm evidence that other health issues beyond the control of infectious diseases have benefited. Between 1998 and 2007, funding for HIV/AIDS control rose from just 5.5\% to nearly half of all aid for health. Over the same period, funding for health systems strengthening declined from 62.3\% to 23.9\% of total health aid and that for population and reproductive health declined from 26.4\% to 12.3\%. Also, even as total aid for health tripled during this decade, aid for health systems strengthening largely stagnated. Overall, the data indicate little support for the contention that donor funding for HIV/AIDS has lifted all boats.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes an explanation concerning why some global health issues such as HIV/AIDS attract significant attention from international and national leaders, while other issues that also represent a high mortality and morbidity burden, such as pneumonia and malnutrition, remain neglected. The rise, persistence and decline of a global health issue may best be explained by the way in which its policy community -- the network of individuals and organizations concerned with the problem -- comes to understand and portray the issue and establishes institutions that can sustain this portrayal. This explanation emphasizes the power of ideas and challenges interpretations of issue ascendance and decline that place primary emphasis on material, objective factors such as mortality and morbidity levels and the existence of cost-effective interventions. This explanation has implications for our understanding of strategic public health communication. If ideas in the form of issue portrayals are central, strategic communication is far from a secondary public health activity: it is at the heart of what global health policy communities do.},

@article{altman1999a,
	Annote = {THis article is a call to consider not just the epidem or economic aspects of the spread but also the polit

The political aspects of globalization may only really be understood through a lens of globalization. Most studies up to this point focused upon the epidemilogical, risk-reduction, and perhaps the psychological.

563: How does AIDS fit these various understandings of ``globalization''? I would suggest in a number of ways, including its epidemiology, the mobilization against its spread, and the dominance of certain dis- courses in the understandings of the epidemic.

Globalization processes have determined the form of the responses to the epidemic, the setting up of global institutions, the bringing of the explanation into a biomedical understanding (as opposed to the "commonsense" way that many peoples understand), and "an emphasis on education and various forms of community mobilization to counter the spread of infection (566)"

This has propogated particular understandings of sexual identity as well as the reach of the state apparatus (which administers or monitors the programs). Has also spread the discourse and practice of human rights.

572: In short, effective AIDS interventions depend upon a number of vari- ables most of which are outside the control of those immediately con- cerned with HIV/AIDS programs and their delivery. These center around the resources available to mount both prevention and care programs, resources in this case encompassing cultural and political factors as much as economic.

What can we learn about theories of globalization from AIDS? 576: I argue that three key propositions stem from this study of HIV/AIDS: that the political/cultural arena remains as important as the economic in understanding processes of globalization; that globalization im- pinges on everyday life through the ways we create and understand identities and emotions; and that globalization urgently requires the creation of e{!'}ective mechanisms for international governance in areas other than those traditionally viewed as global security or economic concerns.

AIDS poses a dilemma: "it weakens the powers of the state without offering any effective substitute."(579)},

	Abstract = {South Africa's peaceful transition is evolving during a period in which spectacular twentieth-century achievements have greatly improved life for one-fifth of the world's population. These are being gradually eclipsed, however, by the impact of social and economic forces that relegate four-fifths of the world's population to increasingly insecure, miserable and impoverished lives. South Africa's negotiated revolution, which has allowed it to move from the pariah status of apartheid to that of a fledgling democracy, exemplifies the paradigm shift required for global progress towards a more just and peaceful world. The HIV/AIDS pandemic, a major threat to South Africa, the African continent and many others around the world, is used in this article as a window through which to view the prospects for the long-term social success of South Africa's transition. It is also used as a mirror to reflect the world in which such a disease could emerge and spread pervasively. The explanatory links between exploitative global economic forces and the emergence of threats to lives are considered, in order to illuminate new pathways towards global progress in which respect for human rights will be further consolidated through promotion of solidarity, interdependence and social justice.},
	Annote = {Globalization has brought about a new relationship with microbes. There's a spectrum 

S. Africa, under globn has undertaken debt-reducing macro-econ policies that have reduced its ability to spend on other stuff; it's not clear how temporary this will be.

Under apartheid, there were massive disparities in health care provision. AIDS has attached ot these disparities. Health care reform has been undertaken since 1994, but the resources are still insufficient and somewhat dusfunctional.

Medical treatment and the technological solution are not availabel in place like SA because of limited resources.

359: "Recognitionoftheadverseeffectosfovertracialapartheidin SouthAfrica,but not of the adverse effectsof covert economic apartheidat a global level, regrettablyreflectsa formof 'selectivemoral blindness'"

High tech approach also suspicious for other reasons: concern over drug company motives and methods; whether a purely biomedical (as opposed to socio-economic measures) approach is the best way to go about improving health; the SA government's vacillation on what to do.

Can't just call for human rights as a panacea. Recognition of civil and political rights doesn't allow for flourishing; also need social and economic rights. ANd even when legally enshrined, it will take time to overcome the heart legacies of discriminatory systems.},

@article{cheru2002a,
	Abstract = {Today in much of Africa economic growth has slowed and living standards for the majority have suffered in the face of rising unemployment and mass poverty, resulting in incomes that are presently below the 1970 level. One problem that has been the focus of much attention and contention over the past 20 years is the huge foreign debt owed by African countries to bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Debt servicing is consuming a disproportionate amount of scarce resources at the expense of the provision of basic services to the poor. In order to receive help in servicing their debts, countries must agree to implement structural economic reforms. This often entails drastic cuts in social expenditures, the privatisation of basic services, and the liberalisation of domestic trade consistent with WTO rules. These policy decisions have had a direct impact on the capacity of African countries to promote, fulfill and protect the right to health of their citizens. This is further compounded by ill-conceived privatisation of basic services such as water and health services, without any regard for the ability of the poor to access these essential services at a cost they can afford. Finally, adherence to WTO trade rules, which often comes as an extension of liberalisation policy, hampers the capacity of African governments to produce or purchase less expensive generic drugs for their citizen without fear of retaliation from the developed countries.},

NGOs have often been at the forefront of innovative changes, influencing government and international programming activities. This paper identifies and analyses the evolution of the HIV/AIDS programmes of one NGO in Thailand over a period of ten years. Three generations of programming are identified both through distinct approaches to this area of work and through the changing jargon used to describe the people the programmes are aimed at.},

	Abstract = {Governments often operate under considerable pressure to respond effectively to the emergence of increasingly complex policy dilemmas. This article first explains some key difficulties in bringing forth comprehensive policy interventions. Despite the ubiquity of social and political constraints to policy innovation, many failures can be attributed to public bureaucracies that are not designed to deal with complex problems, and which all too quickly exceed their policy-making capacities. This study then analyzes why comprehensive policy-making does sometimes occur, and links its occurrence to bureaucratic design factors, arguing that extending organizational capacity for innovation involves more than generous budgets and expertise. The article draws upon, and develops further, Mintzberg's ideas on administrative adhocracy to show how administrative units can be organized to enable bureaucracies to transcend professional compartmentalization and routine; and how structures can be designed for comprehensive policy innovation. The study focuses on Canadian federal bureaucracy, and it is supported by three case studies of recent policy experiments: energy, environment and AIDS. /// Les administrations publiques font face {\`a} des probl{\`e}mes sociaux de plus en plus complexes. Souvent, elles travaillent sous des pressions consid{\'e}rables {\`a} r{\'e}pondre en toute vitesse {\`a} d'{\'e}normes probl{\`e}mes qui ne correspondent ni {\`a} leurs missions originales ni {\`a} leurs structures. Cet article d{\'e}crit d'abord des difficult{\'e}s cl{\'e}s dans le d{\'e}veloppement des interventions publiques compr{\'e}hensives. Malgr{\'e} de multiples contraintes sociales et politiques, beaucoup d'{\'e}checs publics sont d{\^u}s aux administrations publiques qui n'ont pas {\'e}t{\'e} con{\c c}ues pour faire face {\`a} des probl{\`e}mes si complexes, et dont les capacit{\'e}s sont tr{\`e}s vite surpass{\'e}es. L'article explique ensuite pourquoi et comment des interventions compr{\'e}hensives sont possibles, en liant ces succ{\`e}s aux questions d'organisation administrative. La capacit{\'e} {\`a} innover dans une administration publique n'est pas li{\'e}e simplement {\`a} la g{\'e}n{\'e}rosit{\'e} de son budget ni {\`a} son expertise technique; des facteurs administratifs et organisationnels sont aussi importants. L'article d{\'e}veloppe des id{\'e}es de Mintzberg sur l'administrative adhocracy pour d{\'e}montrer comment les unit{\'e}s administratives peuvent {\^e}tre organis{\'e}es pour {\'e}viter le cloisonnement professionnel et les habitudes de routine. Il d{\'e}montre comment les structures administratives peuvent {\^e}tres organis{\'e}es pour permettre et pour favoriser les innovations compr{\'e}hensives. L'{\'e}tude porte sur l'administration f{\'e}d{\'e}rale canadienne; elle repose sure l'examen de trois exp{\'e}riences r{\'e}centes dans les domaines de l'{\'e}nergie, de l'environnement, et de la lutte contre le SIDA.},

@article{dickinson2004a,
	Abstract = {This article addresses the slow response of corporate South Africa to HIV/AIDS. After outlining the impact of HIV/AIDS on the workplace and the corporate reaction, the apparent contradiction between threat and response is explored. Two explanations for the slow response of business are conventionally offered - that government failure to lead a national response to the epidemic confronted business with an insurmountable collectiveaction problem; and that managers misunderstood the vulnerability of their companies. It is argued that these explanations have validity, but do not fully satisfy. Rather, account must be taken of inescapable tensions that tangibly link internal and external environments in ways that pre-date and exist independently of any strategy seeking to respond to HIV/AIDS. Four such tensions are identified: political, moral, industrial relations, and socio-economic. Socio-economic tensions are illustrated and examined through the contemporary views of managers from a large South African firm. While progress has been made by business in responding to HIV/AIDS, these conflicts remain significant. A critical question is whether companies can resolve wider socio-economic tensions - a necessity if they are to protect workers and their skills. In contrast to unitarist calls for a 'war' on AIDS, offering an appropriate corporate response presents a complex and formidable challenge, but also an opportunity for South African management to establish a new role within the post-apartheid order.},

This report documents ethnographic and epidemiologic findings from field visits conducted in Beijing, Chengdu, and Kunming; the latter in Yunnan province, site of China's most severe nidus of HIV infection. This report also elaborates those cultural, social, and political factors involved in China's attempt to manage its growing HIV epidemic. Contemporary attitudes toward sexuality in China which impinge upon such management, as revealed through ethnographic interviews, are reviewed. Data from the First Sino-American Management of HIV Disease Symposium (to which the author was a delegate) are also blended with the ethnographic material to further clarify the cultural and epidemiologic status of HIV/AIDS in China. It is the conclusion of this report that HIV/AIDS and its management pose a transforming, ineluctable challenge to China's traditional attitudes toward sexuality.},

Reports in Western journals are nearly nonexistent, and what is in print does not provide evidence of the infection's historical progress. I traced progress of the infection since my last report (1991) and based current findings on unobtrusive data [HIV blood screening (assays)] provided by State epidemiology-prevention stations and on ethnographic interviews conducted with public health officials from the Center for AIDS Surveillance, Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, and epidemiology personnel in Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Shanghai during fieldwork in China in 1992 and 1993. Cultural, social, economic, and political factors involved in China's historical attempts to manage a growing HIV case rate are discussed. Together, data reveal a widening geographic and social distribution of the virus over time, which, in conclusion, should now qualify China's HIV status as epidemic.},

	Abstract = {The fertility-stimulating effect of high rates of child mortality on reproductive decision making (RDM) is a central tenet of population studies, yet the effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on RDM have not been thoroughly explored in the literature. This paper investigates how RDM is articulated in the context of high HIV/AIDS prevalence in Zimbabwe. Using qualitative methods (35 focus groups and 46 in-depth interviews), we found that childbearing is extremely important in the lives of adult Zimbabweans and that children are needed to cement the couple's relationship, whether it is the first or subsequent marriage. Most respondents said that rates of both adult and child mortality were greatly increasing due to the AIDS epidemic. However, contrary to expectations based upon the insurance strategy, most respondents said that they would have fewer children as a result of the perceived increase in child mortality. They were also hesitant to continue childbearing after a child death, indicating only weak replacement motivation. Instead, many respondents expressed the desire to limit family size due to concerns about their own mortality and its negative effects on their children. Furthermore, new reproductive strategies seem to be emerging, which focus upon the health of parents and child and are based upon perceptions of 100 per cent maternal-infant HIV transmission. Adult HIV status is linked to child survival as respondents explained that having a healthy child who survives to age five indicates that the parents are also free of the virus and, at this point, they can safely continue childbearing. Additionally, couples who have experienced the death of a child are hesitant to give birth again because they believe future children would die. Finally, there was some talk of having children early in an attempt to avoid contracting HIV. This study presents evidence that Zimbabweans are altering their reproductive strategies in order to protect both parents and children from the threat of AIDS.},

	Abstract = {Expectations about why groups and social movements differ in terms of their support for confrontational tactics can be applied to subgroups within a larger set of political activists. Political distrust, personal suffering, ideological intensity, and divergent social locations encourage support for ACT-UP and disruptive political tactics among AIDS activists, with strong mediating effects being exerted by sexual orientation. The data are based on a 1992 national mail survey of AIDS activists. OLS regression was used to analyze the sample as a whole and the subsamples of gay and straight respondents. Whereas distrust and dissatisfaction had a small impact, personal suffering, ideological commitment, and divergent social locations tended to increase support for disruptive behavior. These relationships differed, however, among gays and straights due to their immersion in disparate social networks and milieus. The results highlight the importance of within-movement heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {South African AIDS rights activism, and particularly the work of TAC and the rights frame it has developed, is seen by many as a model for social movements around the world, to champion demands for social equity and the rights promised by democratic citizenship. This essay examines AIDS mobilization and human rights framing in South Africa with a particular focus on the TAC. It argues that while human rights has presented an effective master frame for mobilizing a broad constituency and support base both domestically and internationally, it presents certain limitations in the fight against AIDS given its overwhelming emphasis on individual rights and its focus on the state as the primary violator of rights. In a context where the primary responsibility for combating the AIDS epidemic falls to the state, but where the international political economy presents serious constraints on its ability to do so, this essay also asks whether democratic states can use a rights discourse to challenge global injustices.},

@article{jones2004a,
	Abstract = {If globalisation is the mighty tremor shaking the landscape of the 'project of development', then, in certain regions of the world, HIV/AIDS is surely its epicentre. Nonetheless, for all the burden of the disease, Western donor policy on HIV/AIDS still remains largely silent about the provision of anti-retroviral treatment. This paper seeks explanations for this pervasive medical neglect and donor preference for prevention programmes over treatment. The postcolonial approach taken in the paper is to regard donor policy on HIV/AIDS--as illustrated by the UK's Department for International Development and the Norwegian Agency for Development Co-operation--as cultural and political exchanges framed by prevailing representations of Africa. The different 'logics' which skew policies towards prevention are identified. For donors and African states alike, HIV/AIDS policies--like development interventions more generally--would benefit immensely by foregrounding the human right to health, including, critically, promoting treatment within a genuine 'prevention--care--treatment' policy continuum.},

	Abstract = {Building upon a critical evaluation of the sociologically relevant literature dealing with AIDS, we offer methodological suggestions and outlines of substantive models that promise to address two limitations in the existing literature: the limited range of variables that are considered relevant, and the absence of theoretical guides that specify the interrelationships among putative explanatory factors. The review of the literature and the substantive models focus separately on the onset and on the course of AIDS. The onset of AIDS is modeled as a function of immune deficiency status that is influenced (1) by infection with the AIDS virus and, less directly, by the interrelated social factors that influence exposure to the AIDS virus, (2) by interrelated social factors that influence immune deficiency status more directly, net of effects upon exposure to the virus, and (3) by interrelated common or unique antecedents of these social factors. The course of AIDS is modeled as the outcome of (1) subjective distress associated with infection with the AIDS virus, premorbid indicators, opportunistic diseases, or the perceived adverse consequences of these circumstances, (2) the interrelated adaptive/coping/defensive responses to the subjective distress (e.g. changes in behavioral risk factors, denial, seeking medical care), and (3) the interrelated antecedents of the AIDS-related subjective distress and adaptive/coping/defensive responses. The influence of these variables on the course of AIDS is mediated by their direct or indirect (via exposure to the AIDS virus) effects on immune deficiency status.},

These issues are addressed through a case history of the New York State AIDS Institute, which was established in 1983 and has led the state's drive against AIDS. The AIDS Institute has evolved organizationally as the face of the epidemic has changed and as its political and budgetary environment has changed. The AIDS Institute is an example of a generic entity in public administration-an agency created to advocate attention to, and solutions for, a particular public policy dilemma.},

	Abstract = {This paper replicates and extends an earlier attempt to use data from the General Social Survey (GSS) to track the distribution of AIDS across demographic subgroups. (The GSS asks respondents whether they know a person with AIDS [PWA].) The gender, racial, age, and regional composition of the set of PWAs reported by GSS respondents is compared with that of the official AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In an attempt to assess the accuracy of the GSS estimates, a similar analysis is performed in which GSS respondents are asked whether they know a homicide victim. Data from four consecutive GSS samples (1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991) are used, permitting a more detailed exploration of potential biases and problems with the network technique. In addition, time series data from the National Health Interview Survey on the percentage of people who know at least one PWA are used to validate the GSS data. Our earlier findings, that the GSS identifies proportionately more White and midwestern cases than are reported to the CDC, are corroborated by the additional data. Possible explanations for these discrepancies are given, and suggestions are made for improving the utility of the approach.},

@article{leclerc-madlala2005a,
	Abstract = {This article examines the way in which the Mbeki government in South Africa has proceeded in its policy-making on HIV/AIDS and some of the ways in which people have responded to the epidemic. The protracted tussle between the state and civil society in the form of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) over the terms of engagement for treating the disease has marred South Africa's engagement with HIV/AIDS. The President's embrace of dissident science and his more recent silence on the AIDS issue have contributed to the creation of a climate of suspicion and mistrust. While government has conceded to specific demands of civil society, disagreements remain with organisations such as the Rath Foundation having entered the foray, seemingly with the state's nod of approval and clearly determined to tarnish the reputation of the TAC and subvert the gains made in anti-retroviral treatment. In this context of polarisation, ordinary people have responded by adapting some common ways of thinking and behaving to deal with the exigency of an epidemic that is now impacting on all facets of their lives. Not all popular responses to AIDS, however, resonate with universal principles of human rights. Some are clearly retrogressive and others destructive in their effects. The idea that strategic responses by all sectors of society should help to promote a sense of inclusion and a human rights culture, is the central argument of this article. Ultimately it may not be the gap between policy and implementation that presents the most formidable challenge to South Africa's fight against AIDS and the future of the democratic state, but rather the growing gap between government and an increasingly ill and estranged populace.},

Preferences for playing either the anal receptive or insertive sexual role and a focus on anal intercourse by unacculturated and less acculturated men of Mexican origin who have sex with men are the sexual behaviors judged to be most significantly different from Anglo men who have sex with men in California. Sexual socialization and acculturation were found to be the most important determinants of whether an individual's adult patterns of homosexual behavior will be more or less influenced by Mexican or Anglo homosexuality in spite of the length of time they may have lived in California.

	Abstract = {The HIV epidemic affects people in their most productive ages with adverse impacts on life expectancy, the productivity of the labour force and household incomes. It has not always been possible to measure the economic impact of AIDS empirically with a reasonable degree of precision. Moreover, while there is some evidence of negative individual, household and firm level impact, the empirical evidence on the impacts at the sector and national levels is still weak. While purely humanitarian considerations may be relevant in supporting investments in HIV/AIDS intervention, they may not always appear to be so for finance ministers and planners in developing countries. To justify spending more on policies to address HIV/AIDS in a regime of tight resource constraints, it is sometimes important to justify investments in AIDS prevention and treatment as being more critical relative to other investments. To the extent that HIV/AIDS has large adverse impacts on economic indicators and other socially desirable goals of society, policy action may be desirable, preferably early in the epidemic, rather than later.},

	Abstract = {While the scholarly literature contains many descriptions of the cultural world of the street drug user, these descriptions generally do not focus on the role of religious belief or institutions in the daily life of drug users. This paper examines religious self-identification and perceived religious influence in a national population of street injection drug users at high risk for HIV infection and explores how these self-perceptions might relate to religious institutions as sources of AIDS education and prevention. Hispanics and African Americans were significantly more likely than whites to report they were strongly influenced by their religious beliefs and had received AIDS education from their churches or temples. It is suggested that any comprehensive community AIDS education and prevention efforts directed toward injection drug users should incorporate the religious traditions of those at high risk for AIDS by including community religious institutions, particularly in Hispanic and African American communities.},

	Abstract = {Before the end of 1988, 300,000 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are expected to have been reported worldwide since 1981. Three epidemiological patterns have emerged. One, in the Americas and Europe, is where transmission is primarily among homosexual men and intravenous drug users. In Africa, the virus primarily is spread heterosexually. A third pattern, in Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, is manifested by low prevalence but transmission through homosexual and heterosexual contact and contaminated needles. AIDS cases will increase in number dramatically over the next three years, with devastating social and economic consequences. Health-care systems and economic resources in large cities in the United States will be severely strained. African countries will lose many educated and economic leaders. Many Third World countries will have lower productivity and economic output. A global strategy is emerging to understand and control the spread of AIDS. To provide the commitment and leadership necessary to control AIDS in the rest of the world, the United States must first demonstrate a stronger moral conviction and societal will to control the disease in this country.},

	Abstract = {The projected growth in the U.S. in the number of persons with AIDS has created concern about sources of financing the costs of health care services for persons with AIDS. Private health insurers have modified or considered modifying underwriting practices in response to the AIDS epidemic, but several state governments have developed significant regulatory constraints on AIDS-related underwriting practices. We model the state government's decision to impose AIDSrelated regulatory constraints (HIV testing restrictions, restrictions on the use of information about sexual orientation, and mandated AIDS coverage). We find that HIV-testing restrictions tend to be more likely in states with relatively high AIDS prevalence rates and insurance industries that are relatively weak politically. States with prevailing attitudes favorable to persons with AIDS (i.e., relatively liberal states) are more likely than other states to impose HIV-testing restrictions. Measures of prevailing attitudes (ideology) appear to be the primary determinants of regulations prohibiting questions about sexual orientation, but economic interests are the primary determinants of mandated AIDS coverage.},

	Abstract = {The HIV/AIDS pandemic has afflicted Africa more than any other region of the world. In the United States, the AIDS scourge has disproportionately affected African American communities. In their tragic experiences with HIV/AIDS, both African states and African American communities can benefit from the new communication framework that the United Nations Global AIDS Programme and the Pennsylvania State University have developed to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The framework contains five universal values that are recommended for AIDS intervention programs across the world. The five values are incorporation of government policies, socioeconomic status, culture, gender issues, and spirituality. There are six additional values, two of which apply uniquely to each of the three world regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. For Africa, the two unique values are community-based approaches and regional cooperation. The situation in Africa presents valuable lessons for African Americans in the United States.},

	Abstract = {This is a study of 89 community-based nonprofit organizations in northern California that provide prevention and care services to persons at risk of or infected by HIV. Executive directors responded to a telephone and mail survey concerning community HIV consortia mandated by the Title II provisions of the Ryan White CARE Act. Mandated coalitions are hypothesized to increase the power of the mandating agency over the member organizations; increase interorganizational awareness, interdependence, domain consensus, and cooperation; provide benefits for consortium members; address gaps in community services; influence the division of labor, encourage interorganizational standardization; and stabilize resource exchanges. Although the hypotheses regarding power and stability are not supported, HIV consortia appear to increase organizational interdependence and service-system efficiency. Implications of these findings for theory, research, and policy development are discussed.},

The meeting took place in the country with the largest number of people infected by HIV--the virus that causes AIDS--on the continent that is home to 70% of the world's HIV-infected population. The cruel irony of the unfolding human tragedy is that Africa is also the least equipped region in the world to deal with the multiplicity of challenges posed by the HIV virus. Drawn from ongoing research in southern Africa, this article charts the relationship between poverty, HIV prevalence and the politics of global response.},

	Abstract = {As Africa enters its third decade of structural adjustment pressures, the promised advantages of economic restructuring-as hailed by the various lending bodies-have not been forthcoming. The indelible picture emanating from the continent is one of a people relegated to a position of extreme poverty as state managers and the international community either fail to, or seem unable to, pursue policies that will secure the basic needs of its citizens. To compound matters, HIV and AIDS are threatening to erode the continent's already fragile development capacity. Predicated on the continent's limited economic capabilities, this article charts the relationship between poverty, debt relief and the politics of effective response to HIV/AIDS in Africa. The article begins with an assessment of the societal causes and consequences of the epidemic, moving on to contextualize the case for debts cancellation. It concludes by examining the crucial relationship between debt relief and the successful implementation of effective strategies against the pandemic in Africa.},

Yet the enormity of its promise also speaks to the scope of its mission: to facilitate the financing by governments, corporations, philanthropical bodies and individuals of a massive effort to address the epidemic that has to date outpaced previous efforts at effective control. A key challenge is to devise a governance structure that makes effective action likely, satisfies donors, responds efficiently, and produces observable results. By examining recent developments, this paper seeks to outline facets of the governance challenge facing the Global AIDS Fund.},

	Abstract = {AIDS has been medically visible for 30 years; but only in the last five have the security implications of the pandemic begun to be discussed seriously. This debate has been in many ways unsatisfactory to date. The purpose of this article is to begin to rectify this at the moment when the first major efforts to combat the pandemic are beginning to take effect. It records therefore the history of that debate and ascertains in what useful and defensible senses AIDS can be described and managed as a security issue. It argues that there are, indeed, several that meet these criteria. The article describes the first three engagements with the disease from the time of its discovery and then suggests three newer ones and, it argues, more fruitful approaches that have advanced since 2000 of which the security dimension is one. The others are the geo-politics of the human immune system and analysis through the prism of political economy. The scope of the next waves of AIDS after the southern African one, is depicted. Its coming intersection with oil and Great Power politics is noted.},

	Abstract = {Considerable stigma is attached to HIV/AIDS in various parts of sub-Saharan Africa, in spite of high seroprevalence rates. Stigma, in turn, often fosters discriminatory actions toward HIV-positive persons. Some of the blame for perpetuating stigma and failing to curb discrimination continues to fall upon organized religion (Christianity and Islam), which remains a central institution in many Africans' lives and tends to advocate sexual conservatism. However, little systematic empirical evidence exists to support the suggestion that religion breeds discrimination and stigma about HIV/AIDS. Drawing upon Demographic and Health Survey data from six sub-Saharan countries with elevated HIV infection rates, we evaluate the effect of religious affiliation on different forms of AIDS-based discrimination, paying close attention to possible confounding effects. In most analyses, religious affiliation is unrelated to discriminating against persons-with-AIDS after accounting for ethnicity--a far more robust predictor of discrimination than is religion. Where affiliation does remain significant, Muslims and people who practice other non-Christian religious traditions tend to report more discriminatory attitudes.},

@article{robins2004a,
	Abstract = {This article analyses the complex cultural politics of HIV/AIDS in South Africa. It focuses on how AIDS 'dissident' science impacted on policy discourses and how AIDS activists, together with scientists, the media and health professionals, responded. It also shows how the HIV/AIDS debate and struggles over access to treatment were framed by historically embedded cultural and political interpretations of AIDS that were a product of South Africa's apartheid and post-apartheid history. However, rather than adopting a cultural nationalist response to this historical legacy, activists from the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) deployed a class-based politics that concentrated on access to anti-retroviral drugs rather than debates on the complexities of AIDS causation. This approach contrasts with attempts by AIDS activists in the United States to influence the production of scientific knowledge on AIDS directly, for example, research funding and protocols for trials. The article discusses how TAC and its partner organisation, Medicins Sans Fronti{\`e}res (MSF - Doctors without Borders), strategically positioned themselves in the struggle for access to AIDS drugs, and how new forms of health citizenship, gendered identities and political subjectivities emerged in the course of these struggles. For example, ideas of bodily autonomy associated with liberal individualist conceptions of citizenship collided with patriarchal cultural ideas and practices that prevent many women from accessing biomedical interventions (for example, contraception, HIV testing and treatment). The biomedical paradigm that underpinned TAC/MSF campaigns also had to contend with local understandings of misfortune and illness. While TAC's strategies included networking with global civil society organisations such as MSF, Health Gap, and Oxfam, they also involved grassroots mobilisation and an engagement with local socio-cultural realities. This brand of health activism produced solidarities that straddled local, national and global spaces, resembling what Arjun Appadurai and others describe as 'globalisation from below'.},

	Abstract = {One of the central questions facing policy-makers is how to allocate limited federal funds among alternative AIDS research strategies. A rational answer requires judgments about both the prospects of scientific progress and the societal value of research outcomes. Using a decision-analytic approach, this paper examines the marginal returns from additional funding of basic biology, epidemiology and mathematical modeling, vaccine development and testing, treatment development and testing, and behavioral and social science. A survey of a recent Institute of Medicine Committee on AIDS was conducted to elicit scientific judgments on the prospects for scientific progress in each of the five areas. The scientists were quite capable of transcending their disciplinary orientation as reflected in the dominant sentiment in favor of more behavioral and social science research. A comparison of the actual FY 1987 AIDS research budget with the budgets recommended by the scientific experts also suggests that basic biological research deserves greater emphasis.},

@article{singerrogersglassman1991a,
	Abstract = {In October, 1987, the Centers for Disease Control mounted a massive public information campaign to alert the public to the dangers of AIDS and to provide information about its transmission and prevention. Using data from two Gallup surveys, one just before the campaign began and the other several months after its conclusion, we examine changes in public information and misinformation about transmission, in concern about AIDS as an epidemic, and in reported behavior to avoid exposure to AIDS. We conclude that although some changes in knowledge did take place, these were essentially a continuation of trends beginning before the public information campaign and continuing well after its conclusion. For these and other reasons, we argue that the effects of the campaign on public information were minimal. However, between 1987 and 1988 there was a small but statistically significant increase in reported condom use, an increase paralleled by increased condom sales between 1986 and 1988. In addition, there was a substantial increase in the number of people expressing concern about AIDS as an epidemic for the population at large. The campaign may well have contributed to both of these changes.},

	Abstract = {Federal homogeneity is not always imposed from the center; subnational units can and do influence national policy from the bottom up by developing innovative policies. In South Africa, provincial policies in the area of HIV/AIDS shaped national policies within the context of the overarching normative structure of the national Bill of Rights. The conditions under which this happened were (1) constitutional space for a province to develop an innovative policy and practice, (2) the necessary political will to exploit the constitutional space, and (3) the judicial and political impact of a province's innovative policy on the national policy. While provincial policy informed the court decision, it also furthered the political debate nationally. Finally, intergovernmental competition played an important role in countering the monopolistic tendency that can be produced by cooperative government.},

	Abstract = {The country of Botswana currently has one of the highest HIV infection rates in the world. Government and international aid agencies have undertaken initiatives to address the rapidly growing epidemic, but few measures address the current crisis of care as a key element in that process. In this article, the author uses case study data to highlight how women in Northern Botswana are affected by the increasing burden ofcaregiving to children who are orphaned as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In particular, she describes how the role of women as caregivers in communities has been transformed as a result of the HIV/AIDS crisis. She suggests that the intersecting cultural patterns of migration and reproduction are central to understanding the spread of the disease in the current emerging crisis of care.},

	Abstract = {HIV/AIDS is having profound impacts on livelihoods in sub-Saharan Africa. These include the deaths of working-age adults, the diversion of resources to caring, and the rupture of traditional chains of knowledge transmission. NGOs are responding by providing assistance to communities affected by the epidemic in the fields of agriculture, skills training, and microfinance, as well as by offering home care and support. A key feature of such initiatives is the focus on previously neglected groups such as women, school dropouts, and orphans. Factors of success include the use of participatory processes to identify target groups, and the involvement of local political leaders and adults trusted by young people in project activities. Challenges include improving monitoring systems, effectively disseminating lessons learned, and persuading donors, whose responses to the epidemic are currently focused on preventive and curative health services, to support livelihoods interventions as a matter of urgency.},

	Abstract = {HIV/AIDS is the major threat to development, economic growth and poverty alleviation in much of Africa. And yet the full extent of the catastrophe facing the continent is only just being recognised, and still not by all. The international development targets set by the great and the good of the global community--or at least by those members of the community who attend the international summits that set these goals--do not consider what HIV/AIDS means and are unachievable. This paper begins by setting the scene, describing the epidemic, explaining why it is so important and what makes HIV/AIDS different. It then explores how the poverty/epidemic cycle works, whereby poverty increases the spread of HIV and AIDS increases poverty. It suggests we need to look beyond monetary poverty to understand these relationships. Finally the paper assesses what can and should be done to break the HIV/AIDS poverty cycle.},

	Abstract = {Traditional security studies and international relations theory do little to address the security issues associated with the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Because security studies and international relations have been preoccupied with conditions affecting the major powers, little of the long history of international relations and national security has practical application to Africa and the HIV/AIDS epidemic it is experiencing. From a theoretical perspective many fields of security studies and international relations do not adequately address critical dimensions in dealing with security. Dimensions of time, scope and depth are often overlooked. This point is important regarding the AIDS epidemic because time and extent often determine the security threat and whether it is a short-run threat (which is subject to greater political expediency) or a long-run threat (which is subject to less political expediency). In the short run the epidemic threatens the security of political institutions, the military and military operations. In the long run the security of populations and national economic performance are at risk.},

	Abstract = {The HIV/AIDS pandemic has afflicted Africa more than any other region of the world. In the United States, the AIDS scourge has disproportionately affected African American communities. In their tragic experiences with HIV/AIDS, both African states and African American communities can benefit from the new communication framework that the United Nations Global AIDS Programme and the Pennsylvania State University have developed to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The framework contains five universal values that are recommended for AIDS intervention programs across the world. The five values are incorporation of government policies, socioeconomic status, culture, gender issues, and spirituality. There are six additional values, two of which apply uniquely to each of the three world regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. For Africa, the two unique values are community-based approaches and regional cooperation. The situation in Africa presents valuable lessons for African Americans in the United States.},

It examines the relationship between political processes that affect citizen association, like democracy or various types of war, and the spread of HIV/AIDS. It hypothesizes that political circumstances that promote association will also raise HIV/AIDS levels in the affected countries, while anti-associative pro- cesses will restrain the spread of the disease. Using data sets com- mon in political science and international relations but not in more epidemiological sciences, I conduct time-series-cross-section, fixed- effects regression analysis. The statistics indicate that democracy and democratic transitions are associated with increased HIV/AIDS, while civil and ethnic warfare have lower associated levels of HIV.},

@article{wright2010a,
	Abstract = {This article examines how political institutions that provide an incentive to cultivate a personal vote condition the relationship between foreign aid and economic growth in developing country democracies. Politicians in aid-recipient countries with high levels of personalism are more likely to pursue corruption and target government spending to narrow constituencies. Because personalism affects these outcomes, it provides incentives to use foreign aid for politically motivated spending at the expense of investing foreign aid in growth-promoting public goods. Using panel data from 61 aid-recipient democracies from 1961 to 2001, the author finds that aid increases growth in democracies with less personalist institutions but decreases growth in countries with high personalism. The author also shows that personalism conditions the relationship between aid and the composition of government spending: Aid increases spending on public goods (relative to narrow, particularistic goods) in countries with low personalism but has the opposite effect in highly personalist countries.},

	Abstract = {Migration and aid flows each create links between industrialized and developing countries. Sur- prisingly, the link between these two issue areas remains almost unexplored in scholarly literature. We hypothesize that an increased stock of migrants from an aid recipient in an aid donor will be associ- ated with larger aid flows from the donor to the recipient for two reasons. First, donors may choose to promote development abroad in an effort to decrease the push factors behind migration. To do this they would focus disproportionately on countries that have historically sent large numbers of migrants, since new migrants are attracted to areas where earlier migrants from their home country have settled. Second, diaspora communities within donors may lobby their host government to increase aid flows to their country of origin. We develop these arguments and test hypotheses empirically on a broad sample of data comprised of bilateral aid flows from 19 OECD donors to more than 150 recipients over the pe- riod 1992-2005. We find evidence both that donors use aid flows to stem the tide of unwanted migrants and that immigrants within a donor successfully lobby for aid to their native land.},

@article{lakin2010a,
	Abstract = {Health system reforms that introduce insurance principles into public health systems (such as national health insurance, internal markets, and separation of purchasers and providers) have been popular in the last two decades. Little is known, however, about the political complexities of transforming existing health services into health insurance systems in developing countries. Mexico's Seguro Popular (Popular Health Insurance) program, introduced in 2003, was an attempt to do exactly this: radically alter the country's existing health service and convert it into health insurance. Popular Health Insurance (PHI) has garnered international attention and has been held up as a model for other countries to follow. Yet little has been written about the political process that led to the reform or the difficulties of implementing it. This article fills that lacuna, offering an assessment of the reform context as well as of the process of formulating, adopting, and implementing it. It argues that, while the reform has improved Mexico's public health service, it has thus far failed to transform that health service into a true insurance system. Limited institutional reform has also left PHI severely underfinanced. The Mexican case is a cautionary tale for reformers who want to transform extant health services into health insurance systems.},

	Abstract = {Following Tocqueville, many scholars consider associations ``schools of democracy'' because members can develop civic capacities within them. This article identifies the distribution of civic development opportunities across civic sectors (e.g., politics, service, recreation), focusing on understudied apolitical groups. New data is introduced on a set of often referenced, but rarely studied, associations: choral societies. Choruses are shown to offer numerous opportunities for interpersonal interaction, governance experience and institutional relationships. Data are compared to opportunities offered by associations in other civic sectors. Apolitical arts associations are found to provide as many or more opportunities for individual civic development than their politically-and service-oriented counterparts suggesting their potential for shrinking the political communication gap between naturally politically interested and disinterested citizens.},

@article{fung2003a,
	Annote = {Over the past decade, there has been a resurgence of interest and research into the connections between associations and democracy. This article divides the question of associative contributions to democracy into four component parts: What (a) contributions do (b) different kinds of associations make to advance (c) contesting ideals of democratic governance in various (d) political contexts? Associations enhance democracy in at least six ways: through the intrinsic value of associative life, fostering civic virtues and teaching political skills, offering resistance to power and checking government, improving the quality and equality of representation, facilitating public deliberation, and creating opportunities for citizens and groups to participate directly in governance. These contributions are not all mutually consonant with one another, and different forms of associations are better suited to advance some contributions than others. Furthermore, those who propose bolstering associations as a strategy for revitalizing democracy frequently have quite different ideals of democracy in mind. The forms and contributions of associations appropriate to three contesting notions of democratic governance---liberal minimalism, conventional representation-cum-administration, and participatory democracy---are also discussed. Finally, the democratic priority of associative contributions depends crucially on contextual features of particular societies. Under tyrannical regimes, for example, associations that resist government authority are more crucial than those that foster compliance and respect for political institutions.},

@unpublished{kapstein2009a,
	Abstract = {This paper examines the role of policy entrepreneurs and global activists in shaping the international market for antiretroviral drugs to combat HIV/AIDS. When ARVs first came on the market in the 1990s they were exceedingly expensive; the cost of treatment was upwards of $10,000 per year. These drugs were thus accessible only to those patients who had high incomes. But in 2006, the ``international community,'' meeting at a United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS), made an astonishing pledge to those who were infected with HIV. It proclaimed that there should be universal access to ARV treatment. This UNGASS, following up on an earlier historic UN special session devoted entirely to AIDS in 2001, marked the first time in history that the international community pledged itself to chronic care for the ill, which in this case includes the approximately 30 million people around the world estimated to be HIV positive. How do we explain the transformation of ARVs from private goods, which only a few could afford, into merit goods that were (at least declaratively) to be made available to everyone? In other words, how does a norm of ``universal access to treatment''---that no person should be denied these life-extending drugs---become the ethical basis for global public policy with respect to pharmaceutical allocation? What are the lessons of the ARV story for other global issues? These are the primary questions we explore in this paper. Briefly, we argue that the policy entrepreneurs and activists who promoted the creation of a universal access to treatment regime---of the transformation of ARVs into global merit goods---relied on a combination of moral arguments and ideas with favorable material circumstances. From the ethical perspective, the task of these entrepreneurs was to convince the ``international community'' that access to ARVs was a ``human right,'' or conversely to convince decision-makers that it was morally wrong to allocate these life-enhancing drugs solely on the basis of ability to pay. But from a material standpoint, these arguments were greatly facilitated by the lowering prices of ARVs caused by a combination of differential pricing (that is, lower prices for drugs in the developing world than in the advanced welfare states) and competition from generics producers, coupled with increases in foreign aid spending devoted to HIV/AIDS and other diseases.},

@periodical{altman1992a,
	Abstract = {The cost of treating people infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, is soaring, an international meeting on AIDS was told here today.

The lifetime cost of treating an AIDS patient in the United States is now $102,000, up from $85,333 in 1991, said Dr. Fred J. Hellinger, a Federal official who has been tracking the costs of caring for people infected with H.I.V. for the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, an arm of the Public Health Service. The figure was $57,000 in 1988.

The annual cost of treating an American AIDS patient is now $38,300 and the average cost of treating an H.I.V.-infected individual who has not yet developed AIDS is about $10,000, Dr. Hellinger said. A year ago, the estimated costs were $32,000 and $5,100, respectively.

By contrast, Americans' lifetime treatment cost is $52,000 for breast cancer and $175,000 for kidney failure. Lower Costs Elsewhere

The increase reflects a wide variety of new therapies that have been introduced to combat the virus, which weakens patients' immune systems, and the many other opportunistic infections that strike as a result. But while the treatments improve patients' quality of life, researchers debate whether the therapies have actually allowed them to live longer.

After a person is infected with H.I.V., the virus remains silent for many years, sometimes up to a decade. Then as the immune system breaks down, the virus causes the AIDS and a litany of health problems. Many of the recently developed therapies for H.I.V.-infected individuals are intended to delay the progression to AIDS.

Charles Cameron of the Harvard School of Public Health told the meeting that the amount spent per year on an AIDS patient was $22,300 in Western Europe, $2,000 in Latin America and $393 in African countries south of the Sahara.

Dr. Hellinger said the cumulative cost of caring for Americans with H.I.V. since AIDS was first diagnosed in 1981 would reach $15.2 billion by 1995.

The soaring costs in the United States were tracked through a Federal program analyzing the services used by 2,000 H.I.V.-infected people in 10 cities. Dr. Hellinger said he also used data from state officials in California, Florida, Hawaii and New York. Expensive Treatments

The marketing of new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration accounts for much of the rising costs, and many therapies also require monitoring with expensive laboratory tests. Among the recently marketed drugs for H.I.V. and AIDS patients that Dr. Hellinger cited were these:

*Didanosine (DDI) for treatment among individuals who cannot use AZT. A week's treatment costs $40.

*Erythropoietin to treat anemia at a cost of $200 per week.

*A drug to increase the number of white blood cells that is approved for treating cancer patients but that doctors prescribe for some H.I.V. patients. The cost is $1,000 a week.

*Drugs to treat opportunistic infections like cytomegalovirus (Acylovir) and fungi (Fluconazole).

One of the most expensive drugs is foscarnet, which is used to treat a blinding condition, retinitis, that is caused by cytomegalovirus. Act Up, an AIDS advocacy and protest group, says foscarnet costs more than $20,000 a year. Astra, the world's only manufacturer of foscarnet, says it offers a 15 percent discount on all its products, including foscarnet, to more than 1,600 community health centers and other groups that treat AIDS patients in the United States.

Act Up members knocked over Astra's booth in the convention hall here to protest the Swedish company's pricing of the drug. Challenging Other Theories

A Canadian study challenged claims that AIDS is caused by something other than H.I.V., as some critics have contended. Among the other possible causes the critics suggest are unusually high levels of sexual activity or use of psychoactive drugs.

Dr. Kevin J. P. Craib's team in Vancouver, British Columbia, studied more than 711 gay men. Of these, 350 never showed evidence of H.I.V., 237 were already infected when the study began in 1982 and 128 became infected afterward.

About half the uninfected men said they used psychoactive drugs and a quarter reported many instances of receptive anal intercourse with casual partners, a very high risk factor for AIDS.

Of 136 AIDS-related illnesses that developed in the closely monitored group, all occurred in men infected with H.I.V. None of the uninfected men showed evidence of abnormality in their immune system. The count for CD4 cells, a monitoring test for immune function, remained stable in the uninfected group but fell steadily in the infected groups.

Only two uninfected men died, one from a heart attack and the other by suicide. Of those infected throughout the study, 80 died of AIDS-related conditions, and of those who became infected, 21 died from such illnesses.

Scientists around the world continue to seek what additional factors might speed the progression of H.I.V. infection to AIDS. But the problem with AIDS is as it is for many other diseases. Scientists do not know why some people can smoke heavily and escape lung cancer or heart disease, while others who smoke less succumb to these and other tobacco-related conditions. Impact of Depression

In a surprising finding, Federal researchers analyzed five studies and found no increased risk of infection in the second of two children born to an H.I.V.-infected mother, regardless of whether the first-born was infected or uninfected. Many researchers had believed that there was an increased risk of infection for a second child.

Another study, from the University of California at San Francisco, found that the condition of H.I.V.-infected men who were also depressed, as measured by a standard diagnostic scale, declined more rapidly and death came sooner than in infected men who were not depressed. In the six-year study of 330 gay and bisexual men, monitoring tests showed that a type of white blood cell dropped 38 percent faster in those who were depressed than in those who were not.

About a third of the 330 men died, and the proportions were the same among those who were depressed and those who were not. But the depressed men were more likely to die faster.

"It is clear that depression is correlated with a worse prognosis in H.I.V. disease," said Dr. Jeffrey Burack, the principal author of the study. "We know that it is not just that people who are sicker become more depressed, since we measured depression before disease occurred."},

In the first, the capability of management to monitor and respond to emergent events at the shop level is bounded. In the second, production decisions are coordinated among shops without the centralization of information, whose capability of semiautonomous problem solving improves through learning by doing. This study is motivated by a U.S.-Japan comparison of industrial organization.},

	Abstract = {Combining the work of Peter Blau and Jerald Hage regarding organizational characteristics and efficiency, a correlational model was constructed consisting of testable propositions relating organizational size, complexity, stratification, formalization, centralization, and two measures of efficiency. The model was also extended to include hierarchical levels, after vertical and horizontal measures of complexity were separated. Following an extensive review of the literature, both official and self-reported data from one type of economic organization (104 savings and loan associations in New York State) were employed to test the propositions in a profit-oriented context. While the findings demonstrate limited support for the model in this special type of economic organization (five of thirteen propositions were fully or partly supported by the analysis), a further classification and comparison of studies reviewed, according to the type of organization under study, suggests that a unified theory encompassing both economic and non-economic organizations is feasible.},

	Abstract = {This paper empirically investigates the proposition that the organization and operation of the large enterprise along "M-form" multidivisional lines favors goal pursuit and least-cost behavior more nearly associated with the neoclassical profit maximization hypothesis than a number of alternative organizational forms. Using a sample of petroleum firms during the period 1955-1973, a positive relationship between M-form structure and profitability is observed during the period in which the M-form innovation was being diffused. This relationship is no longer observed once an organizational form equilibrium is achieved. The results provide support for the "Markets and Hierarchies" paradigm, but additional studies are needed to affirm the generality of the finding.},

	Abstract = {Disease and Democracy is the first comparative analysis of how Western democratic nations have coped with AIDS. Peter Baldwin's exploration of divergent approaches to the epidemic in the United States and several European nations is a springboard for a wide-ranging and sophisticated historical analysis of public health practices and policies. In addition to his comprehensive presentation of information on approaches to AIDS, Baldwin's authoritative book provides a new perspective on our most enduring political dilemma: how to reconcile individual liberty with the safety of the community.
Baldwin finds that Western democratic nations have adopted much more varied approaches to AIDS than is commonly recognized. He situates the range of responses to {AIDS} within the span of past attempts to control contagious disease and discovers the crucial role that history has played in developing these various approaches. Baldwin finds that the various tactics adopted to fight AIDS have sprung largely from those adopted against the classic epidemic diseases of the nineteenth century--especially cholera--and that they reflect the long institutional memories embodied in public health institutions.},

	Abstract = {This article examines whether transnational networks reconfigure state-civil society relationships in ways that lead to civil society empowerment and increased organizational capacity to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Mexico. Using a comparative case study, I identify the types of transnational networks and exchanges that both help and hinder community-based HIV/AIDS organizations (CBOs) that provide AIDS prevention and treatment services in Tijuana and Mexico City. Data derive from over 50 formal interviews, organizational documents and archival records, and observation. I argue that the form and function of transnational networks is shaped by the geo-political context of local organizational fields and that, in turn, transnational networks provide innovative opportunities for civil society-state partnerships that favor some local organizations over others. Ultimately, I take apart the prevailing assumption that transnational networks are inherently good, and show how they can (re)produce inter-organizational stratification at the local level. The conclusions of this research are helpful to international health practitioners and social scientists seeking to understand how civil society's participation in transnational networks can both challenge and reproduce existing community-state power regimes and health inequities.},

The costs and benefits of processing information are linked to the structure of the firm and its

	Abstract = {Empirical research on the determinants of economic growth has typically
neglected the influence of religion. To fill this gap, we use international survey data on
religiosity for a broad panel of countries to investigate the effects of church attendance
and religious beliefs on economic growth. To isolate the direction of causation from
religiosity to economic performance, we use instrumental variables suggested by our
analysis of systems in which church attendance and beliefs are the dependent variables.
The instruments are dummy variables for the presence of state religion and for regulation
of the religion market, an indicator of religious pluralism, and the composition of
religions. We find that economic growth responds positively to the extent of religious
beliefs, notably those in hell and heaven, but negatively to church attendance. That is,
growth depends on the extent of believing relative to belonging. These results accord
with a perspective in which religious beliefs influence individual traits that enhance
economic performance. The beliefs are, in turn, the principal output of the religion
sector, and church attendance measures the inputs to this sector. Hence, for given beliefs,
more church attendance signifies more resources used up by the religion sector.},

	Abstract = {Abstract  Since the beginning of the 1980s, historical institutionalism has emerged as one of the most influential theoretical perspectives in social policy studies. Although their work is insightful, most institutionalist scholars tend to relegate policy ideas to the back of their theoretical constructions dealing with welfare state development. The objective of this paper is to show how institutionalist scholarship can pay greater attention to ideational processes without abandoning its core assumptions about the structuring impact of political institutions and policy legacies on welfare state development. If institutions truly influence policy-making, policy ideas matter in and beyond the agenda-setting process. Related to existing policy legacies, perceived problems mesh with policy alternatives grounded in a specific paradigm. When stressing the need to reform, and promoting new alternatives, policy entrepreneurs draw on existing ideological repertoires to frame these alternatives. The ability to successfully frame policy alternatives can become a decisive aspect of the policy process. A discussion of recent European and North American policy debates illustrates these claims.},

@misc{bell2003,
	Abstract = {Most existing estimates of the macroeconomic costs of AIDS, as measured by the
reduction in the growth rate of GDP, are modest. For Africa -- the continent where
the epidemic has hit the hardest -- they range between 0.3 and 1.5 per cent annually.
The reason is that these estimates are based on an underlying assumption that the main
effect of increased mortality is to relieve pressure on existing land and physical capital
so that output per head is little affected. We argue that this emphasis is misplaced and
that, with a more plausible view of how the economy functions over the long run, the
economic costs of AIDS are almost certain to be much higher. Not only does AIDS
destroy existing human capital, but by killing mostly young adults, it also weakens the
mechanism through which knowledge and abilities are transmitted from one generation
to the next; for the children of AIDS victims will be left without one or both parents to
love, raise and educate them.
To analyze this problem, we use an overlapping generations (OLG) model, in which
parents have preferences over current consumption and the (expected) human capital
attained by their children. Two family structures are analyzed: `nuclear' and `pooling',
whereby under the latter all children are cared for within an extended family. The decision
about how much to invest in education is influenced by premature adult mortality
in two ways: first, the family's lifetime income depends on the adults' health status,
and second, the expected pay-off depends on the level of premature mortality among
the children when they attain adulthood. Furthermore, if one or both parents die while
their offspring are still children, the transmission of knowledge across generations is
weakened.
The outbreak of AIDS leads to an increase in premature adult mortality, and if the
prevalence of the disease becomes sufficiently high, there may be a progressive collapse
of human capital and productivity. The policy problem, therefore, is to avoid such
a collapse. The instruments available for this purpose are (i) spending on measures
to contain the disease and treat the infected, (ii) aiding orphans, in the form of either
income-support or subsidies contingent on school attendance, and (iii) taxes to finance
these expenditures.
When calibrated to South Africa, the model yields the following results. In the absence
of AIDS, the counterfactual benchmark, there is modest growth, with universal
and complete education attained within three generations. If nothing is done to combat
the epidemic, however, a complete economic collapse will occur within three generations.
With optimal spending on combating the disease, and if there is pooling, growth
is maintained, albeit at a somewhat slower rate than in the benchmark case in the absence
of AIDS. If pooling breaks down, and is replaced by nuclear families, growth will
be slower still. Indeed, if school-attendance subsidies are not possible, growth will be
distinctly sluggish. In all three cases, the additional fiscal burden of intervention will
be large, which reinforces the gravity of the findings. Sensitivity analysis suggests that
these findings are robust to changes in a variety of key assumptions and parameter values
concerning mortality, the efficiency of measures taken to combat it, and the formation
of expectations. A delay in responding to the outbreak of the epidemic, however, can
lead to a collapse.},

	Abstract = {Why did the Soviet Union use less force to preserve the Soviet empire from 1989 to 1991 than it had used in distant and impoverished Angola in 1975? This book fills a key gap in international relations theories by examining how actors' preferences and causal conceptions change as they learn from their experiences.Andrew Bennett draws on interviews and declassified Politburo documents as well as numerous public statements to establish the views of Soviet and Russian officials. He argues that Soviet leaders drew lessons from their apparent successes in Vietnam and elsewhere in the 1970s that made them more interventionist. Then, as casualties in Afghanistan mounted in the 1980s, Soviet leaders learned different lessons that led them to withdraw from regional conflicts and even to abstain from the use of force as the Soviet empire dissolved. The loss of this empire led to exaggerated fears of domino effects within Russia and a resurgence of interventionist views, culminating in the Russian invasion of Chechnya in 1994. Throughout this process, Soviet and Russian leaders and policy experts were divided into competing schools of thought as much by the information to which they were exposed as by their apparent material interests. This helps explain how Gorbachev and other new thinkers were able to prevail over the powerful military-party-industrial complex that had dominated Soviet politics since Stalin's time.},

	Abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a growing interest among scholars of international relations, and global environmental governance in particular, in the role of transnational networks within the international arena. While the existence and potential significance of such networks has been documented, many questions concerning the nature of governance conducted by such networks and their impact remain. We contribute to these debates by examining how such networks are created and maintained and the extent to which they can foster policy learning and change. We focus on the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) program, a network of some 550 local governments concerned with promoting local initiatives for the mitigation of climate change. It is frequently asserted that the importance of such networks lies in their ability to exchange knowledge and information, and to forge norms about the nature and terms of particular issues. However, we find that those local governments most effectively engaged with the network are mobilized more by the financial and political resources it offers, and the legitimacy conferred to particular norms about climate protection, than by access to information. Moreover, processes of policy learning within the CCP program take place in discursive struggles as different actors seek legitimacy for their interpretations of what local climate protection policies should mean. In conclusion, we reflect upon the implications of these findings for understanding the role of transnational networks in global environmental governance.},

	Abstract = {Data from a stratified random sample of 71 installations from nine executive departments of the U.S. government are analyzed so as to replicate and reexamine the findings of Blau and Schoenherr from state employment agencies on the relations between size and various components of complexity. Although results have some similarity, many significant differences are found, especially for relationships of personal specialization and division of labor with other variables. Generally, size is a more important predictor of complexity with the Blau and Schoenherr data, while division of labor is a more important predictor with the federal data. Two possible explanations for the differences in findings are investigated: size and technology. Comparison of analyses for small and large organizations from both studies yields no coherent patterns. Comparison of parallel analyses for routine and nonroutine federal organizations gives a pattern of significant differences that partially duplicates the differences found between the two studies. In the study of federal organizations, however, all effects of size on horizontal differentiation are indirect, being mediated by division of labor in routine organizations and by personal specialization in nonroutine organizations. Implications of the findings for Blau's deductive theory and for the understanding of causes of organizational structure are discussed.},

As long as you have enough observations, you can probably handle the

these polynomials with your cross-sectional unit (if, for instance,
you think these trends are different in each country or something
similar). This is because you'd need 3 polynomials terms for each
country. You can read about this in the Honaker and King paper.

The second question is more subtle, but I think a reasonable answer is
put in as many polynomials as your data will allow. The higher order
terms won't hurt your imputations as long as the algorithm can still
run with them and they'll drop out (have a zero beta term) if they
don't provide any help in prediction.

good luck.

So we're actually literally taking the year number (e.g., 2000) and
squaring or cubing it? but that then allows us to find the betas and use
them in creating the imputed values.

How does one decide what order of polynomial to include in the imputation?
What are the theoretical reasons behind the particular choice one might
make?

Hey Nathan,

The treatment of this subject is taken up in Honaker and King (2007),
which you can find here:

http://gking.harvard.edu/files/pr.pdf

The basic idea here is that we might be able to write variables as a
(noisy) function of time. Think about drawing a graph with gdp on the
y-axis and time on the x-axis. You might imagine that there would be
some curve that could track the movement of gdp through time. We can
approximate that curve using a polynomial of function of the x-axis,
time.

Thus, think of t={1960,1961,...,2000}. We're writing a function of
these numbers. If this was the only way we were predicting GDP, then
we would estimate GDP in 1970 as:

GDP_{1970} = b_0 + b_1*{1970} + b_2*{1970^2} + b_3*{1970^3}

where the b's are estimated from the Amelia algorithm. We usually
would want to include other variables as they will help us predict GDP
as well, but this is simply illustrative.

Amelia will only include up to a cubed term for you, but you could
always add the terms yourself by doing something like:

amelia.data <- cbind(data, (data$time)^2,(data$time)^3,(data$time)^4)

and then don't tell amelia to include polynomials of time. Off the top
of my head, i think that should work the same as the way amelia does
it.

hope that helps,
matt.

Matt,

Can you explain what it is the Amelia is doing when it takes polynomials of
time? Specifically, I'm interested in what occurs computationally in
refernce to a passage like this in the manual:
" Amelia
can build a general model of patterns within variables across time by
creating a sequence of polynomials of
the time index. If, for example, GDP varies smoothly over time, then we make
the modeling assumption that
there exists some polynomial that describes the economy in cross-sectional
unit i at time t as: GDP (t)i =
0 + 1 t + 1 t2 + 1 t3 . . . And thus if we include enough higher order
terms of time then the pattern between
observed values of GDP can be estimated"

What's going on with that time term there? Can Amelia only go up to cubing
the t?

	Abstract = {    Political Science as an academic discipline has been slow to grapple with the enormous implications of the AIDS crisis for much of the developing world. This article argues that important research agendas link AIDS and politics, and that more work in these areas could contribute to the struggle to cope with the pandemic. Research could also yield theoretical advances in the field of political science. Five research agendas for Africa are: variations in state response to the pandemic; the relationship between governments and NGOs; the AIDS challenge to neoliberalism; AIDS and North-South tensions; and connections between AIDS and international security issues.  },

Many different sociometric structures can yield the same algebraic multiplication table, which captures a different level of social structure. Elements of the algebras are interpreted concretely as compound roles, and interlock among these roles is studied through investigation of their algebraic properties (equations and inclusions). Similarities and differences among algebras from six case studies are explored by means of homomorphisms as well as by multidimensional scaling on a derivative numerical distance measure. Results for particular populations, including reliability and stability tests, are summarized through simple target tables reporting aggregations of more complicated role structures.},

	Abstract = {Justinian's Plague, the Black Death, the Great Plague, cholera, influenza, tuberculosis, and AIDS---these diseases and others have devastated human lives and society for generations, decimating populations, creating panic, and wrecking social and economic infrastructure. In  Epidemics Laid Low  epidemiologist and historian Patrice Bourdelais analyzes the history of disease epidemics in Europe from the Middle Ages to the present.

This captivating account describes how populations respond to crises of disease and how authorities deal with the devastation afterward. Bourdelais discusses the successes of northern European countries in fighting and controlling infectious diseases and emphasizes, by comparison, the failures of the countries in the south. He links success to several factors: ideology of progress, economic development, popular demands to improve public health, and investment in medical research. Bourdelais studies the social consequences of these policies, the changes in the representation of epidemics, the behaviors of populations, and heightened tensions between advocates of individual freedom and those of collective interest.

Epidemics continue to threaten us today. What do our responses to these threats say about our priorities? Will the security of public health remain a privilege of a few powerful countries or will poorer countries benefit from the efforts of the rich to prevent the spread of disease inside their own borders?},

	Abstract = {Background: UNAIDS has developed the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) as a tool for national programmes to use for making national estimates and short term projections of HIV prevalence. EPP provides direct input to Spectrum, which produces incidence, deaths, and AIDS impacts.  Methods: The latest version, EPP 2005, includes substantial methodological improvements over the previous version. These include: (1) parallel, but unique, interfaces for generalised and concentrated epidemics; (2) use of maximum likelihood fitting procedures; (3) a new procedure, known as level fits, adjusting for expansion of national surveillance systems into lower prevalence sites; (4) provisions for handling turnover in at-risk populations, including the reassignment of HIV positive former members to lower risk populations; and (5) user-defined calibration to HIV prevalence levels from general population or other epidemiological surveys.  Results: Following regional training in mid 2005, this new version has been applied by many national programmes to make their end of 2005 estimates of HIV infections. UNAIDS has combined these national estimates to form the 2005 global HIV and AIDS estimates.  Conclusion: EPP 2005 is a substantial improvement over previous versions, forming a solid base for the next round of modifications. Proposed modifications for that next version are presented for the reader's information.

	Abstract = {The authors advance a theory of the effects of political institutions on state policy. The theory explains how political institutions affect the ability of leaders to maintain themselves in office, why some political systems are more prone to policy failure than others, and why autocrats create mass political systems. The key characteristics of institutions in this theory are the sizes of a polity's selectorate and winning coalition. The authors derive hypotheses from the theory and test those hypotheses using a data set covering more than 2,700 leaders from all states in the period from 1816 to 1990. The statistical tests demonstrate that (1) large winning coalitions are associated with enhanced economic growth, (2) tenure is shortened by a large winning coalition but lengthened by a large selectorate, and (3) in the face of policy failure, leaders with a large selectorate are more likely to survive than those in systems with a large winning coalition. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of these results.},

	Abstract = {Institutional arrangements influence the type of policies that leaders pursue. We examine two institutional variables: size of the selectorate (S) - the set of people who have an institutional say in choosing leaders - and the size of the winning coalition (W) - the minimal set of people whose support the incumbent needs in order to remain in power. The larger the winning coalition, the greater the emphasis leaders place on effective public policy. When W is small, leaders focus on providing private goods to their small group of supporters at the expense of the provision of public goods. The size of the selectorate influences how hard leaders work on behalf of their supporters. The greater the size of the selectorate, the more current supporters fear exclusion from future coalitions. This induces a norm of loyalty that enables leaders to reduce their effort and still survive. As a first step towards a theory of endogenous selection of institutions, we characterize the institutional preferences of the different segments of society based on the consequences of these institutions for individual welfare. We conclude by examining the implication of the model for the tenure of leaders, public policy, economic growth, corruption, taxation and ethnic politics.},

@unpublished{busby2005hiv,
	Abstract = {In the twenty plus years since AIDS was first identified, more than 20 million people have died of the disease, most of them in the developing world. Since 2001, the international community has become increasingly active on this issue. In June 2001, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called for the creation of a Global Fund to combat HIV/AIDS and said such a fund would require $8-12 billion annually of financing to conduct its operations. In 2002, the advanced industrialized countries pledged that they would support the fund. Activists, for their part, demanded that advanced industrialized countries contribute to the Global Fund on the basis of their share of global income. Some countries---the UK and the United States, for example---have made pledges and disbursements in keeping or exceeding their share of world income. Other countries---Japan and Germany for example---have lagged either in pledges or actual disbursements to the fund. Why are some countries more generous than others in their support of efforts to combat HIV/AIDS? This paper suggests that explanations based on state and individual self-interest provide a plausible first cut. However, they tend to downplay the normative and moral motivations of the general public and decision-makers. This paper draws on theories of strategic framing and veto powers to explain these anomalies and inadequacies. This paper emphasizes the way advocates have framed their case in moral terms and thus elicited the support of faith communities. This has mobilized political pressure and simultaneously convinced key policy gatekeepers in different national contexts that the values at stake were sufficiently important to warrant higher spending.},

@article{buzan1984,
	Abstract = {This article compares the merits of three concepts -- peace, power and security -- as approaches to the study of International Relations. It argues that peace and power offer only partial, and significantly flawed, views, and yet that thinking within the field has become locked into an excessively polarised framework which is dominated by the opposition between them. The necessity for a new framework arises from the intellectual exhaustion and restrictiveness of this prevailing orthodoxy. Security is put forward as an alternative framework which is capable of encompassing most of what is useful from the other two, plus much of the middle ground that is obscured by them. The argument proceeds by comparing the quality of insight which each of the three concepts offers into two of the most fundamental elements in international relations: 'the anarchy' and 'the arms race'. The case is made that each of these elements consitutes a highly durable feature of international relations, but not that is either immutable within its form, or necessarily malign in its effect. Power and peace are seen to give only narrow and incomplete views of the anarchy and the arms race. Both result in excessively rigid and negative interpretations, with power leading to an over-emphasis on the inflexibility of both elements, and peace leading to over-optimism about their removability. Security is seen to offer a more balanced perspective. It takes into account the durability of the anarchy and the arms race, but does not lead to necessarily negative views of them. It opens up the considerable scope for positive change which exists within the two elements, and so provides the basis for a synthesis of realist-idealism.},

	Abstract = {The twenty-first century has already begun, writes Barry Buzan. He analyses post-Cold War, post-East-West power relations and traces the consequences of changed relationships between the great powers of the North (or 'centre') for states in the South (or 'periphery'). The centre is now more dominant, he argues, and the periphery more subordinate to it than at any time since decolonization began. In that sense, Western capitalism has triumphed over both communism and Third World ideology. Among the possibilities he outlines are the development of a civilizational 'cold war' between North and South in the coming decades as Islam is pushed to the front rank of opposition to Western hegemony; continued militarization in the South; and, as decolonization recedes into the distant past, an assault on post-colonial boundaries there, as we saw in the Gulf crisis. Societal concerns, he writes, are likely to assume a prominence on the security agenda that they have not held since before the establishment of the modern European states system.},

	Abstract = {Global poverty, economist Collier points out, is actually falling quite rapidly for about 80\% of the world. The real crisis lies in a group of about 50 failing states, the bottom billion, whose problems defy traditional approaches to alleviating poverty. Here, Collier contends that these fifty failed states pose the central challenge of the developing world in the twenty-first century. This group of small nations, largely unnoticed by the industrialized West, are dropping further and further behind the majority of the world's people, often falling into an absolute decline in living standards. A struggle rages within each of these nation between reformers and corrupt leaders--and the corrupt are winning. Collier analyzes the causes of failure, and offers a bold new plan.--From publisher description},

	Abstract = {This paper present first results from a new survey on bureaucratic structure in Africa.  The aims of the survey were to gain quantitative data on incentives and structures of the African bureaucracies and to ensure comparability of the new data with existing data sets, in particular the data sets provided by Rauch and Evans (1999) and World Development Report (1997).  First we study the evidence on bureaucratic structure across Africa. We find quite large differences in structure and performance between country's in the region and also between Africa and other regions of the world. Second we incorporate the African data into the larger sample of developing countries which allows us to estimate whether meritocratic bureaucracies perform better, have lower corruption and higher efficiency in their service delivery and provide better framework for the private sector.  We find that the African countries in general are not ``a case of their own'' but are described reasonably well by the same incentive structures as other countries: Better bureaucratic performance is associated with greater power and autonomy of agencies to formulate policies, good career opportunities in the public sector, good pay of public servants and little shifting between public and private employment.},

@article{cullet2003a,
	Abstract = {The question of access to drugs in developing countries is at present largely influenced by the TRIPS Agreement. TRIPS compliance in the field of health requires substantial changes to existing patent laws in some countries. These changes must be analysed in the context of the spread of epidemics like HIV/ AIDS and in relation to other international obligations that states have, for instance, with regard to the human right to health. Intellectual property rights treaties today have significant impacts on the realization of some human rights like the right to health. This article examines the extent to which TRIPS encompasses flexibility for developing countries to be able to foster better access to medicines. It also examines these issues from the point of view of human rights and considers, in particular, the ways in which the relationship between human rights and intellectual property can be improved in international law.},

	Abstract = {The HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa has far‐reaching implications for governance and development. In addition to killing millions of individuals and causing serious economic contractions, the pandemic threatens structural transformations in African economies, institutions and governance. Decreased adult life expectancy has important adverse impacts upon savings, capital accumulation, skills acquisition, and institutional functioning. This article examines how the impacts of the pandemic can be envisaged as running processes of demographic transition, economic development and the growth of a bureaucratic state, in reverse. Meanwhile, expanded HIV/AIDS programming is likely to become a major feature of some African countries. The article examines different models for social and political mobilization against the pandemic and sketches a unified framework for understanding its impact.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: In responding to the goal of rapidly increasing access to antiretroviral treatment (ART), the government of Botswana undertook a major review of its health systems options to increase access to human resources, one of the major bottlenecks preventing people from receiving treatment. In mid-2004, a team of government and World Health Organization (WHO) staff reviewed the situation and identified a number of public sector scale up options. The team also reviewed the capacity of private practitioners to participate in the provision of ART. Subsequently, the government created a mechanism to include private practitioners in rolling out ART. At the end of 2006, more than 4500 patients had been transferred to the private sector for routine follow up. It is estimated that the cooperation reduced the immediate need for recruiting up to 40 medically qualified staff into the public sector over the coming years, depending on the development of the national standard for the number and duration of patient visits to a doctor per year. Thus welcome relief was brought, while at the same time not exercising a pull factor on human resources for health in the sub-Saharan region.},

@article{elbe2006,
	Abstract = { Should the global AIDS pandemic be framed as an international security issue? Drawing on securitization theory, this article argues that there is a complex normative dilemma at the heart of recent attempts to formulate the global response to HIV/AIDS in the language of international security. Although "securitizing" the AIDS pandemic could bolster international AIDS initiatives by raising awareness and resources, the language of security simultaneously pushes responses to the disease away from civil society toward military and intelligence organizations with the power to override the civil liberties of persons living with HIV/AIDS. The security framework, moreover, brings into play a "threat-defense" logic that could undermine international efforts to address the pandemic because it makes such efforts a function of narrow national interest rather than of altruism, because it allows states to prioritize AIDS funding for their elites and armed forces who play a crucial role in maintaining security, and because portraying the illness as an overwhelming "threat" works against ongoing efforts to normalize social perceptions regarding HIV/AIDS. These overlooked dangers give rise to a profound ethical dilemma as to whether or not the global AIDS pandemic should be portrayed as a security issue. The article concludes that securitization theory cannot resolve this complex dilemma, but that raising awareness of its presence does allow policy makers, activists, and scholars to begin drawing the links between HIV/AIDS and security in ways that at least minimize some of these dangers. },

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the design of administrative procedures when policy consequences are uncertain. In general, when deciding how much discretion to delegate, legislators must trade off informational gains from agency expertise and distributive losses from bureaucratic drift. We show that when Congress has both ex post agenda control and access to information, it will delegate a large degree of discretionary authority to all agencies, regardless of differences in policy preferences. This "discretionary floor" rises as future events become more uncertain. We further show that the possibility of coalitional drift, or changing preferences of the median legislator, may lead either to "hard-wired" agencies with little discretionary authority or "soft-wired" agencies with large discretionary powers to set policy.},

	Annote = {Was anybody out there checking out jobs with the U.S. post office in 2005? Do you remember when you called that 800 number to get details? Sure you do. Do you remember how the voice on the other end of the line helping you had this soft British accent with a slight African lilt? Do you know why? Because you were routed to a call center in Kenya.

So maybe you weren't looking for a job, but you had just bought a new computer. And when you turned it on, you clicked the icon for one of America's biggest Internet service providers to get broadband access. But you needed someone to talk you through getting it connected --- so you called that 800 number. The techie who helped you was also a Kenyan at that same Nairobi call center.

It's called KenCall. It is located in an abandoned avocado processing plant, and it is the largest of Kenya's blooming outsourcing call centers, with almost 300 employees and annual revenues that have grown to $3.5 million since it opened three years ago. If you're surprised it's here, so are most of its customers.

``I was actually talking to someone in America who had just given birth and she was ordering high-speed D.S.L. for her new residence --- three or four hours after the birth,'' said Nina Nyongesa, a 25-year-old KenCall supervisor and I.T. graduate of Nairobi University. ``She said to me, `Where are you?' I said, `Nairobi.' And she said, `Are you sure?' And she was really happy --- so she bought one for herself, one for her mother and one for her mother-in-law. So instead of making one sale I made three.''

KenCall is one small reason that Kenya's economy grew 6 percent last year. Yes, Kenya still has all the ills of other African states --- from AIDS to abject poverty. But Kenya also now has a democratically elected government that is learning to get out of the way of Kenya's entrepreneurs and to get them the bandwidth they need to compete globally. It's way too early to declare Kenya an economic ``African Tiger,'' but something is stirring here that bears watching --- and KenCall is emblematic of it.

The company was started by the half-English, half-Kenyan Nicholas Nesbitt, his brother Eric and his brother-in-law Stephen Liggins. Nicholas Nesbitt and Liggins had made successful careers on Wall Street. But after Kenya's democratic elections in 2002, they decided to come home and see if they could do good for their country and for themselves by taking advantage of Kenya's large pool of educated, English-speaking talent to break into the outsourcing industry.

There was one big problem. Kenya, like the rest of East Africa, was not connected to any global undersea fiber-optic cable that would give it the cheap high-speed bandwidth of the scale needed by call centers. The Internet here all came via satellite, which is more expensive to begin with and was made even more so by the fact that the Kenyan state phone company had a monopoly.

In a rare move in Africa, the Kenyan government decided to give up that monopoly and open competition for satellite-provided bandwidth --- even though it meant laying off 6,000 government workers. The competition made KenCall's business possible. The Kenyan government is now working feverishly to get connected to the global fiber-optic network, via an undersea cable, which would make bandwidth here cheap and plentiful enough for all sorts of outsourcing.

KenCall opened in late 2004, taking orders for U.S. late-night TV commercials. Its Kenyan operators sold Yellow Page ads, security alarms and mortgages. But it has since grown its business to include data-entry for one of the premier Wall Street credit-rating firms and handling service calls for global banks and insurance companies. For an economy dependent on coffee, safaris and flowers, this is a real change of pace.

``The concept of connecting to the outside world and attracting investors from the outside --- that has not been here before,'' remarked Stephen Ogunde, another KenCall supervisor.

KenCall's employees can make in a month what half of Kenya's population makes in a year: around $350. They get health care and free transportation.

Don't give up on Africa. KenCall is a reminder that with a little less government regulation, a little more democracy and a lot more bandwidth, African entrepreneurs can play this game too. ``In the old days, `landlocked' meant you didn't have a harbor,'' said Mr. Nesbitt. ``In the new days, it means you don't have fiber broadband to the rest of the world. This whole market here is just waiting for that.'' },

According to reported figures, an excess in the number of cases has occurred during recent years, mainly among young adults of both sexes. The present estimated rate of TB is 51.7 cases/100,000 inhabitants. This is the most frequent endemic infection among AIDS patients, ranking third among infectious diseases after candidiasis and P. carinii pneumoniae. A total of 8.3% of the 19,352 AIDS cases notified to July 1994, presented TB as the initial manifestation. According to sentinel surveillance carried out since 1990 in 17 states, HIV seroprevalence among TB patients has been 3.1% (0-6.5%) in males and 1.0% (0-2.3%) in females. Results of epidemiologic research in the field of TB prevention and characteristics of drug sensitivity of strains of M. tuberculosis isolated from HIV/AIDS patients are also described. Finally, perspectives of TB prevention and control are discussed.},

of knowledge. It shows that a knowledge-based hierarchy is
a natural way to organize the acquisition of knowledge when matching
problems with those who know how to solve them is costly. In such
an organization, production workers acquire knowledge about the
most common or easiest problems confronted, and specialized problem
solvers deal with the more exceptional or harder problems. The
paper shows that the model is consistent with stylized facts in the
theory of organizations and uses it to analyze the impact of changes
in production and information technology on organizational design.},

characterized by positive sorting between workers and managers when knowledge 
acquisition takes place before production. We extend the analysis and find that 
complementarities between manager and worker skill are even stronger when 
knowledge is acquired on the job. We then examine empirically the existence of 
sorting in law firms along the dimensions of cognitive ability and experience. We 
find strong evidence of positive sorting by cognitive ability, as proxied by the quality 
of the law school attended, but little evidence of sorting by experience, suggesting 
little substitutability between cognitive ability and experience.},

Agents organize production by matching with others in knowledge hierarchies designed to use and communicatie their knowledge efficiently. Relative to autarky, organization leads to larger cross-sectional differences in knowledge and wages: low-skill workers learn and earn relatively less. We show that improvements in the technology to acquire knowledge lead to aopposite implication on wage inequality and organization than reductions in communication costs.},

	Abstract = {Why have some national governments acted more aggressively to address the HIV/ 
AIDS pandemic than others? More specifically, what explains widely varied responses 
across Brazil and South Africa---two countries where one might have expected more 
similarity than difference? We argue that boundary institutions---those sets of rules 
and practices that give social and political meaning to group identities---help explain 
this puzzle. Institutions interact with other pressures to structure the dissemina- 
tion of information, the construction of risk, and priorities within society. Where 
institutions divide groups deeply, elites and ordinary citizens are less likely to feel 
vulnerable, and more likely to blame other groups, making aggresive government 
action far less likely.

	Abstract = {This paper addresses hierarchical models with continuous dependent variables, such as time- series cross-section models. Building on the argument in Zorn (2001), the main point of this paper is that the pooled OLS estimator is deeply flawed -- especially for time-series cross-section data -- but for reasons that have not explicitly been raised in previous papers. The pooled OLS estimator, the within-estimator, the between-estimator, and the random effects estimator can be seen as special cases of the fractionally pooled estimator presented in Bartels (1996), which allows all of these estimators to be evaluated in a common framework. Taking bias and efficiency into account, using both the within estimator and the between estimator is likely to be the best estimation strategy for the vast majority of applications in political science.},

	Abstract = {This article examines the model of social learning often believed to confirm the autonomy of the state from social pressures, tests it against recent cases of change in British economic policies, and offers a fuller analysis of the role of ideas in policymaking, based on the concept of policy paradigms. A conventional model of social learning is found to fit some types of changes in policy well but not the movement from Keynesian to monetarist modes of policymaking. In cases of paradigm shift, policy responds to a wider social debate bound up with electoral competition that demands a reformulation of traditional conceptions of state-society relations.},

@article{hammond2007,
	Abstract = {The formal hierarchical structures of organizations can be expected to affect the organizations' behavior in many different ways. One kind of impact is that their structures may affect how their knowledge is organized. This is important because the different ways in which knowledge can be organized may affect what the organizations' decision makers learn from the information that their organizations have gathered, stored, and processed. However, rigorous testing of this general argument would not be easy, and so it would be useful if a preliminary means of assessment could be found so that we can better judge whether a full-scale test is warranted. Hammond (1993) noted that a library catalogue is also a formal structure for hierarchically organizing knowledge, which means that different kinds of cataloguing systems represent different ways of organizing knowledge. Two different kinds of cataloguing systems --- the Library of Congress classification and the Dewey Decimal classification --- are widely used in US libraries, and Hammond conjectured that these two different cataloguing systems will tend to bring different sets of books to the attention of library users; this in turn should be expected to have consequences for what the library users can most easily learn from the library. This article tests Hammond's conjecture in two university libraries, focusing on 40 classic books in political science. The results provide strong empirical support for the conjecture: although the two cataloguing systems do not appear to organize knowledge in completely different ways, what differences they do have nonetheless appear to have a striking impact on what users can most easily learn. Support is thus provided, albeit indirectly, for the general argument that how organizations are structured hierarchically should be expected to affect what organizational decision makers are able to learn.},

	Abstract = {This paper traces the development of policies dealing with HIV/AIDS in Botswana from their beginning in the late 1980s to the current programme to provide population-wide anti-retroviral therapy (ARV). Using a variety of source material, including long-term ethnographic research, it seeks to account for the failure of Western-inspired approaches in dealing with the pandemic. It does this by looking at the cultural and institutional features that have created resistance to the message and inhibited effective implementation. The negative response to the first educational campaign stressing condom use is described and contextualized in terms of Tswana ideas of morality and illness. Nor, as was initially expected, did the introduction of free ARV therapy operate to break the silence and stigma that had developed around the disease. Take-up was very slow, and did not operate to encourage widespread testing. In 2003, key policymakers in Botswana began to argue for a break with the AIDS 'exceptionalism' position, with its emphasis on voluntarism, confidentiality and the human rights of patients. This resulted in routine testing being introduced in 2004. This links to a major argument running through the paper which is that the failure of policy cannot be attributed solely to the nature of local populations. Western cultural assumptions about 'good practice' also require critical examination.},

@article{hernandez-tepichin2000a,
	Abstract = {The current total of AIDS cases in Mexico is 37,000 of which 86{\%} have occurred in men. The major route of transmission is sexual. The campaign to prevent AIDS has fallen into four phases, and has now been extended to other sexually transmitted diseases, including hepatitis B. The first phase (1985-1989) was based around question and answer brochures, which increased awareness but did not remove misconceptions. A mass media campaign addressed these misconceptions and stressed preventive measures. The campaign was halted by opposition to the promotion of condom use on the grounds that it encouraged promiscuity. The second phase (1989-1992) used more conservative messages, but these were too obscure and failed to reach the target audience. A poster campaign using popular lottery characters was widely accepted. In the third phase (1992-1994), a combination of messages was targeted at different populations, including parents and women, and general public sympathy for social support for people with AIDS was encouraged. In the fourth phase (1996-2000), a mass media campaign was aimed at teenagers, with parents and teachers as support groups. The campaign was widened to include HBV infection, and posters and brochures for teenagers were produced. These are distributed as part of a collaboration with non-governmental organizations providing sex education. The private medical sector is being encouraged to provide facilities for hepatitis B vaccination. So far the campaign has only been established in Mexico City, but it is hoped that this will be extended nationwide. Hepatitis B vaccination has been recently included in the National Immunization Programme for infants in the first year of life and it is officially recommended for at-risk populations.},

@article{huber1991a,
	Abstract = {This paper differs from previous examinations of organizational learning in that it is broader in scope and more evaluative of the literatures. Four constructs related to organizational learning (knowledge acquisition, information distribution, information interpretation, and organizational memory) are articulated, and the literatures related to each are described and critiqued. The literature on knowledge acquisition is voluminous and multi-faceted, and so the knowledge acquisition construct is portrayed here as consisting of five subconstructs or subprocesses: (1) drawing on knowledge available at the organization's birth, (2) learning from experience, (3) learning by observing other organizations, (4) grafting on to itself components that possess knowledge needed but not possessed by the organization, and (5) noticing or searching for information about the organization's environment and performance. Examination of the related literatures indicates that much has been learned about learning from experience, but also that there is a lack of cumulative work and a lack of integration of work from different research groups. Similarly, much has been learned about organizational search, but there is a lack of conceptual work, and there is a lack of both cumulative work and syntheses with which to create a more mature literature. Congenital learning, vicarious learning, and grafting are information acquisition subprocesses about which relatively little has been learned. The literature concerning information distribution is rich and mature, but an aspect of information distribution that is central to an organization's benefiting from its learning, namely how units that possess information and units that need this information can find each other quickly and with a high likelihood, is unexplored. Information interpretation, as an organizational process, rather than an individual process, requires empirical work for further advancement. Organizational memory is much in...

@article{hunt1996a,
	Abstract = {
There are fundamental differences in the epidemiological patterns of AIDS in Africa and the United States. A number of theories have been advanced to explain these differences. These theories may be divided into two basic approaches, theories based upon biological explanations and theories based upon social explanations. Biological based theories include a socio-biological explanation and a natural history explanation. The social theories may be divided into three theories which are historical/materialist in their explanation of AIDS in Africa and one theory which is primarily idealist and cultural in its explanation. The present article critically examines these biological and social theories. It argues that the biological theories lack scientific support, lack sufficient evidential support, have an inequality of cause and effect, and fail to integrate the micro/macro. This article argues that the social theories also have some major difficulties including, in some cases, a failure to integrate the micro/macro and a lack of adequate or sufficient causation to produce the massive epidemic of AIDS in Africa. There are difficulties with the quality of evidence and support for the social theories and more research needs to be conducted, particularly in the form of retrospective studies, to determine the validity of various social theories which attempt to explain the epidemiological patterns of the AIDS epidemic in Africa.},

@article{izazola-licea1995a,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze HIV homosexual transmission in Mexico, epidemic trends and biological and social risk factors. METHODS: This analysis is based on 19,090 notifications of AIDS cases and on a review of two previous studies that include 3,029 behavioral interviews (together with HIV serological screening tests) carried out at the Information Center of the Mexican Council for Control and Prevention of AIDS (CONASIDA) (1988-89) and during a 1988 study in six Mexican cities. Cities were included because they were the larger in the country and/or because they were the larger in the country and/or because they were touristic places (Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Acapulco, Tijuana and Merida). Logistic regressions were used to estimate the odds ratios for HIV seropositivity and for condom use. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of the total reported AIDS cases (19,090) up to June 30, 1994, were associated with male homosexual behaviors. In absolute numbers, cases under this category exhibited a rising trend until the end of 1993. HIV seroprevalence was 31% in 2,314 men with homosexual practices who attended "FLORA", the AIDS Information Center in Mexico, from January 1988 to June 30, 1989. The main predictive variables for seropositivity were exclusive homosexual behavior, more than 40 lifetime sexual partners, mixed sexual behavior (both insertive and receptive and intercourse), sex with a person with AIDS, history of syphilis, and anal or genital warts. In general, these risk factors (data from the Information Center) are similar to those found in the six Mexican cities study. There were significant differences in HIV prevalence among the high-risk city samples (the highest in Mexico City with 25% and the lowest in Monterrey with 2.4%). Reported condom use was very low in both studies: only 5% used a condom in all of their sexual relationships. A statistically significant protective effect for HIV infection was found only for those who reported using a condom in all sexual encounters. In the six cities study, city of residence was a strong predictor of condom use. CONCLUSIONS: HIV homosexual transmission is steadily increasing; the recent decline in the percentage of homosexual cases is artificial because of the increment of cases under other categories. Men who report exclusive homosexual behavior have higher prevalence rates of infection than bisexual men. Individuals with insertive/receptive behavior (mixed) have the highest risk for HIV seropositivity, mainly because of sociological, rather than biological reasons. This difference in risks for HIV and condom use may be related to the selection of sexual partners from specific social networks. Condom use was demonstrated to be an effective method for preventing HIV seropositivity among those who always use condoms. However, it is alarming that only 5% of respondents reported condom use in all sexual encounters. Social and geographic differences in the cumulative numbers of cases, HIV prevalence, sexual practices and condom use must be taken into account in the planning of preventive programs.},

	Abstract = {National expenditures on HIV/AIDS were estimated as summary indicators to assess the country's response to HIV/AIDS. The methodology is based on a matrix system describing the level and flow of health expenditures on HIV/AIDS: an adaptation of the National Health Accounts methods. The expenditures were classified by source (public, private, international), by the use of funds (prevention, care), by object, and by type of provider institution. The results are reported in US dollars using the official exchange rate for the year of estimation. For international comparisons monetary units were adjusted by the purchasing power parity (US dollars PPP). National HIV/AIDS total expenditures were: Guatemala US dollars PPP29.5 million, Uruguay US dollars PPP 32.5 million, Mexico US dollars PPP 257 million, and Brazil US dollars PPP 587.4 million during 1998, and Honduras US dollars PPP 33.9 million for 1999. The total HIV/AIDS expenditures per capita for 1998 were: Brazil US dollars 2.69, Mexico US dollars 1.25, Guatemala US dollars 1.08, Uruguay US dollars 6.63, and Honduras US dollars 3.6 for 1999. The 1998 distribution of the total HIV/AIDS expenditures in prevention and care were, respectively, Brazil 10 and 80%, Guatemala 15 and 70%, Mexico 29 and 66%, Uruguay 36 and 51%, and Honduras 28 and 65% for 1999. The share of total expenditures on antiretroviral drugs ranged from 52% in Guatemala to 75% in Brazil, even when the estimated coverage of antiretroviral therapy was close to 10% in Guatemala and universal in Brazil. The estimated flow from international sources per capita in 1998 was Uruguay US dollars 0.03, Brazil US dollars 0.24, Guatemala US dollars 0.11, Mexico US dollars 0.01, and Honduras US dollars 1.04 in 1999. The data allow international comparisons and provide critical information to improve equity and efficiency in the allocation of scarce resources. The National HIV/AIDS Accounts also constitute a powerful tool to describe the country's response to HIV/AIDS.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of HIV/AIDS on economic growth and poverty in Botswana and estimate how providing treatment can mitigate its effects. METHODS: Demographic and financial projections were combined with economic simulation models, including a macroeconomic growth model and a macro-microeconomic computable general equilibrium and microsimulation model. RESULTS: HIV/AIDS significantly reduces economic growth and increases household poverty. The impact is now severe enough to be affecting the economy as a whole, and threatens to pull some of the uninfected population into poverty. Providing antiretroviral therapy can partly offset this negative effect. Treatment increases health's share of government expenditure only marginally, because it increases economic growth and because withholding treatment raises the cost of other health services. CONCLUSION: Botswana's treatment programme is appropriate from a macroeconomic perspective. Conducting macroeconomic impact assessments is important in countries where prevalence rates are particularly high.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Male circumcision is known to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV, but few studies have been performed to assess its acceptability among either children or adults in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional survey in nine geographically representative locations in Botswana to determine the acceptability of male circumcision in the country, as well as the preferred age and setting for male circumcision. Interviews were conducted using standardised questionnaires both before and after an informational session outlining the risks and benefits of male circumcision. RESULTS: Among 605 people surveyed, the median age was 29 years (range 18-74 years), 52% were male, and >15 ethnicities were represented. Before the informational session, 408 (68%) responded that they would definitely or probably circumcise a male child if circumcision was offered free of charge in a hospital setting; this number increased to 542 (89%) after the informational session. Among 238 uncircumcised men, 145 (61%) stated that they would definitely or probably get circumcised themselves if it were offered free of charge in a hospital setting; this increased to 192 (81%) after the informational session. In a multivariate analysis of all participants, people with children were more likely to favour circumcision than people without children (adjusted odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.4). Most participants (55%) felt that the ideal age for circumcision is before 6 years, and 90% of participants felt that circumcision should be performed in the hospital setting. CONCLUSIONS: Male circumcision appears to be highly acceptable in Botswana. The option for safe circumcision should be made available to parents in Botswana for their male children. Circumcision might also be an acceptable option for adults and adolescents, if its efficacy as an HIV prevention strategy among sexually active people is supported by clinical trials.},

	Abstract = {A programme of research on learning in international relations began developing in the 1980s. However, learning research has not realised its potential. This article seeks to stimulate new work on learning by analysing why learning is important in international relations and outlining a research focus that reflects this assessment of learning's significance. The research so far has mostly treated learning as a foreign policy phenomenon, but this fails to capture one of the major reasons for interest in learning. Learning matters in part because of long-standing debates about whether it is possible to make progress in reducing the amount of armed conflict in world politics. For such progress to occur, it is likely that some form of learning would have to take place. However, learning by just a single state will often not be sufficient to change the quality of international outcomes. There thus needs to be research specifically on the possibility of shared learning by two or more states, a research focus this article will label `international learning'. A few illustrative examples will demonstrate the feasibility of doing research on shared, cross-national learning.},

	Abstract = {The field of security studies has been the subject of considerable debate in recent years. Attempts to broaden and deepen the scope of the field beyond its traditional focus on states and military conflict have raised fundamental theoretical and practical issues. Yet, adherents to the prevailing neorealist approach to security studies have often reacted to these challenges in ways that preclude a recognition of the issues raised by alternative understandings. An examination of the debates over rethinking security in particular reveals an unfortunate tendency to foreclose debate between scholars taking critical and neorealist approaches. Coming to terms more fully with the foundations of these debates allows both a better view of the positions within the field and a clearer assessment of their relevance for understanding the dynamics of contemporary security.},

	Abstract = {    The connection between domestic politics and international cooperation, specifically the relationship between regime type and alliance behavior, is examined to test two central hypotheses: democracies are more likely to ally with each other, and states of any similar regime type are more likely to ally with each other. These hypotheses emerge from three theories: constructivism, economic interdependence, and credible commitments. The authors use a data set of all pairs of states from 1816 to 1992. Results show that states with similar regime type are more likely to ally with each other after 1945, although two democracies are not more likely to ally than two autocracies during this period, and distance, learning, threat, and common culture affect alliance behavior, but trade does not. Results indicate sharp limits to the connection between democracy and international cooperation.},

	Abstract = {Organizational learning is conceived apart from inertia by drawing from the literature on organizations and cognitive psychology. Organizational learning is predicted to be cumulative and specific (limited in space and time) rather than noncumulative or general (applied to diverse subjects and new tasks). It is also expected to reflect important subject and learner characteristics that are expressed in two competing models: the first assumes that subject difficulty impedes learning and the second assumes that apparent inhibitors actually facilitate learning. Correlations are examined among successive estimates of foreign military spending, for the same countries and years, published by the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). Learning scores, for different nations, are regressed on potential learning inhibitors and facilitators that are linked to the two models. Learning in ACDA is most convincingly shown to be specific (though cumulative and noncumulative). Learning appears to occur with moderate challenges and to be determined primarily by learner characteristics.},

	Abstract = {A set of hypotheses derived from experiential learning and a realpolitik orientation to crisis bargaining are employed to investigate the bargaining behavior of pairs of states embroiled in recurring crises. It is proposed that in crisis bargaining, experiential learning focuses on the outcome of the preceding crisis, and the lessons drawn from that experience are interpreted in accordance with a realpolitik orientation that stresses the importance of a credible demonstration of power and resolve. The hypotheses predict that in crises between states of relatively equal military capabilities, successful outcomes encourage policymakers to repeat the bargaining strategy employed in the previous crisis, while failures lead to more coercive bargaining in the next crisis. Employing events data from a sample of 18 disputes among 6 pairs of states, each pair having been engaged in three successive crises, a significant pattern of shifts to more coercive bargaining following crises with unsuccessful outcomes was found.},

	Abstract = {The article analyses the impact of historical experiences on practical politics and policy making by political leaders. Although one can enhance his understanding of world politics by incorporating historical learning into models of foreign policy decision making, he must first deal with some important conceptual and methodological problems. Recent research on learning explicitly builds on theoretical concepts and analytical techniques from other disciplines. Some have applied cognitive scripts and heuristics from social psychology to examine the role of analogical reasoning in decision making through both artificial intelligence models and case study methods. Although these studies provide additional reason to believe that learning plays an important role in the formulation of foreign policy, we need to address several important analytical problems before we can make further progress in the theoretical construction and empirical testing of models of learning. In this article the author draws on the theoretical insights of learning-related research on international political economy, institutions, and epistemic communities and also draw on comparative politics and organizational theory, most of his applications are in the area of international security.},

This paper begins an investigation of how and why national governments have responded to the AIDS pandemic in different ways. It provides a theoretical overview of the problem of AIDS policy-making, likening it to other forms of state-building under pressure. It also
carries out a preliminary data analysis, but finds no statistically important relationships between hypothesized social, economic, and political variables (except for GDP/capita and AIDS prevalence) and .

	Abstract = {Within the span of a decade, the HIV/AIDS pandemic swept the African continent, making already tragic human conditions even worse. The severity of this contagious disease, and the shared international policy pressures it engendered, created a natural experiment for investigating the political and other determinants of policy responses. Subject to similar challenges, why have polities responded in different ways? In this paper, I investigate the impact of ethnic politics on policy. I propose a theory which specifies the influence of ethnicity on assessments of risk of contagion, with consequences for the political costs of government (in)action. Using two different measures of policy aggressiveness, I find through cross-country regression analyses that politically relevant ethnic diversity negatively influences government responsiveness to HIV/AIDS. This is particularly tragic for sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic is most severe, and where ethnicity is often a central component of political life. Nonetheless, as a discussion of the statistically outlying case of Uganda demonstrates, ethnicity is not destiny.

	Abstract = {Complex global interdependence continues to influence international legal and political affairs at the close of the twentieth century. As interdependence has tightened, non-state actors have emerged in many policy areas as key political and service delivery players; often supporting increasingly prioritized human- centered issues. Analysis of the global management of the HIV/AIDS pandemic suggests that use of international quasi-legislation can be employed in order to create space within which to manage these changes, thus opening room for dis- cussion about new approaches to meeting the challenges of a changing world.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the experience of the Immunodeficiency Clinic of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Hospital Infantile de Mexico "Federico Gomez", in the management of children with HIV infection and AIDS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: the medical records of 130 patients with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of HIV/AIDS seen between September 1985 and June 1994 were reviewed. Data was obtained regarding diagnosis, epidemiological risk factors, clinical features, types and numbers of bacterial and opportunistic infections, malignancies, hospitalizations, general and specific treatment and outcome. The diagnosis followed CDC guidelines and was established in all 130 patients serologically with ELISA and Western Blot. In infants < 18 months, diagnosis was made by detection of p24 and/or viral culture in two separate occasions. RESULTS: Data from 130 subjects was obtained; 74 were male and 56 female for a M:F ratio of 1.3:1. With regards to mode of transmission, 62.3% was vertical, 20.8% post transfusion, 8.5% hemophiliacs (the latter two males were cases before occurred 1987), 6.2% sexual and 2.2% unknown. With regards to additional risk factors, in 35 cases the parents were heterosexual, in 18 one parent had a history of transfusion, and in eight the father was bisexual. According to the CDC classification; 16 had indeterminate infection or PO; nine were asymptomatic or P1; and 105 were symptomatic or P2. Eighty two patients had nonspecific findings, 60 had neurologic manifestations, 18 had lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia and four had secondary malignancies. It was possible to document 296 episodes of secondary infections: 154 bacterial, 58 opportunistic, and 84 with other pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: in Mexico, as in other Western countries, vertical transmission has become the dominant form of acquiring HIV infection in children, reflecting a change in the epidemiology of infection in women of child bearing age. Moreover, since IV drug use is a very limited phenomenon in Mexico, heterosexual transmission is the major form of transmission in women.},

@misc{mccleary2003,
	Abstract = {Two important theories of religiosity are the secularization hypothesis and the religionmarket
model. According to the former theory, economic development reduces religious
participation and beliefs. According to the latter theory, religiosity depends on the presence of a
state religion, regulation of the religion market, suppression of organized religion under
Communism, and the degree of religious pluralism. We assess the theories by using survey
information for 61 countries over the last 20 years on church attendance and religious beliefs. In
accordance with the secularization view, overall economic development---represented by per
capita GDP---tends to reduce religiosity. Moreover, instrumental estimates suggest that this link
reflects causation from economic development to religiosity, rather than the reverse. The
presence of an official state religion tends to increase religiosity, probably because of the
subsidies that flow to organized religion. However, in accordance with the religion-market
model, religiosity falls with government regulation of the religion market, Communist
suppression, and a reduction in religious pluralism. Although religiosity declines overall with
economic development, the nature of the interaction varies with the dimension of development.
For example, religiosity is positively related to education and the presence of children and
negatively related to urbanization.},

	Abstract = {Botswana has the second highest HIV prevalence rate and highest rate of orphanhood in the world. Although child mortality rates have doubled in 15 years, the extent to which health disparities are connected to orphan status remains unclear. We conducted an analysis of the 2000 Botswana Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey to examine whether orphan-based health disparities exist. We measured health inequalities using anthropometric data among 2723 under-five year olds, nested in 1854 households, and 208 communities. We calculated multilevel logistic regression models to estimate the child, household, and regional determinants of growth failure. We found that orphaned children aged 0-4 are 49% more likely to be underweight than nonorphans (p<0.05) controlling for household poverty and other factors; and orphans disproportionately live in the poorest households. Throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Botswana is a leader in responding to the AIDS epidemic, in particular as one of the first countries to offer universal antiretroviral treatment. However, orphan-based health disparities confirm that the orphan response is still insufficient. Better data are needed to fully understand the mechanisms that lead to these disparities, and the public sector needs an increased capacity to fully implement the policies and programs designed to meet the needs of orphans. Findings from this study have important implications for countries throughout SSA, and Southern Africa in particular, where the number of orphans has doubled to tripled over the past 15 years.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of the Mexican HIV/AIDS surveillance system between 1986 and 2001. DESIGN: All information was collected through an extensive literature search. METHODS: Databases such as the Mexican National AIDS Programmes RIMSIDA (Registry of Mexican AIDS Research), MedLINE, PopLine, and AIDSLINE were used. Databases, keywords, and MeSH headings to search were discussed and agreed upon before and during the literature search. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty articles and conference abstracts were reviewed and showed that the Mexican surveillance system has undergone many adaptations. The HIV/AIDS surveillance system began in 1986, when the focus was on identifying AIDS cases. This period was followed by special studies among risk groups, and served as the basis for the sentinel surveillance system that was adopted in 1990. The system now requires HIV and AIDS case reporting as well as sentinel surveillance. Mexico has also carried out the piloting of the behavioural surveillance component of Second Generation Surveillance. CONCLUSION: The Mexican experience illustrates how surveillance systems need to be dynamic in order to monitor trends in HIV over time. This review also demonstrates that middle-income countries can successfully implement surveillance systems. However, although Mexico has had many successes, a need exists to address issues that limit its ability to implement AIDS case and behavioural surveillance fully and consistently.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE. To describe the epidemiological profile of AIDS and malignancies in Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The study population included a group of AIDS patients seen at four National Institutes of Health and one at a general hospital in Mexico City, from 1983 to 1992. Demographic, clinical and laboratory information was obtained. RESULTS. A total of 202 patients were studied; 199 men and three women. The mean age was of 34.5 years (range 18-67 years). Kaposi's sarcoma was the most frequent malignancy, with 166 cases, followed by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with 33 cases. The three women had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, one of them associated with cervical carcinoma. Rectal cancer was present in three cases. DISCUSSION. The spectrum of AIDS-associated malignancies in Mexico is similar to that described in other populations. The early diagnosis of this complication is necessary, as well as the search for therapeutic actions to prevent severe immunosuppression and the consequent appearance of malignancies.},

An analysis of the adaptive characteristics of natural nonlinear and chaotic systems, as applied to organizations, may help to provide a suitable prescription for organizations wishing to survive and thrive into the next millennium.},

	Abstract = {    The concepts of regimes and learning have been developed in the Liberal theory of international relations, but their application has been mostly in the area of international political economy. U.S.-Soviet relations are generally explained solely in terms of Realist theory. The dichotomy is unfortunate because both strands of theory have something to contribute. Although the injunctions of an overall regime do not govern the U.S.-Soviet security relationship, it is possible to identify the injunctions and constraining effects of regimes in subissues of the security relationship. In five areas of the nuclear relationship (destructive power, control problems, proliferation, arms race stability, and deterrent force structure), it is possible to identify different degrees of learning and to see how such learning affects and is affected by the development of regimes. Looking at the U.S.-Soviet security relationship in terms of learning and regimes raises new questions and opens a research agenda which helps us to think more broadly about the processes of political change in this area.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology for estimating HIV prevalence in Africa. I 
use mortality data based on sibling histories in the Demographic and Health Surveys to 
calculate the number of deaths from HIV, and use these data to infer prevalence in 
previous years. This methodology allows consistent estimation of prevalence rates over 
time and across regions within a country. Where it is possible to compare, I find that 
prevalence estimated based on mortality data is consistent with the prevalence from the 
testing data. The results confirm new estimates from population-based testing that 
indicate UNAIDS estimates of the extent of the epidemic are overstated. However, the 
methodology here dramatically expands the set of consistently estimated prevalence rates 
-- I present estimated prevalence over the entire course of the epidemic in nine countries, 
and prevalence by region in these countries in the recent period. The methodology also 
has potential to provide estimates of HIV prevalence for other sub-groups within Africa, 
and could be extended to calculate prevalence of other diseases elsewhere.

	Abstract = {
Considerable interest has arisen in the role of governance or political commitment in determining the success or failure of HIV/AIDS policies in sub-Saharan Africa. During the 1990s, Uganda and South Africa both faced dramatic HIV/AIDS epidemics and also saw transformations to new political systems. However, their responses to the disease differed in many ways. This paper compares and contrasts the ways in which policy environments, particularly government structures, can impede or expedite implementation of effective HIV prevention. Four elements of these environments are discussed--the role of political leadership, the existing bureaucratic system, the health care infrastructure, and the roles assigned to non-state actors. Two common international strategies for HIV prevention, syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections and sexual behaviour change interventions, are examined in relation to these elements in Uganda and South Africa during the mid-to-late 1990s. During this period, Uganda's political system succeeded in promoting behaviour change interventions, while South Africa was more successful in syndromic management efforts. Interactions between the four elements of the policy environment were found to be conducive to such results. These elements are relatively static features of the socio-political environments, so lessons can be drawn for current HIV/AIDS policy, both in these two countries and for a wider audience addressing the epidemic.},
	Annote = {Notes

Four mechanisms at work here:
1. Role of leadership: Mandela and Mbeki v. Mouseveni; S.A.: consensus and inclusion prioritized, and things that potentially disrupted that were sidelined; Uganda: Museveni emphasized it and made it high on the agenda. "Nonetheless, emphasising the important of leadership is not sufficient to explain sustained outcomes.

2. Bureaucratic system: biggest difference is in the flexibility of systems. S.A.'s system developed under the apartheid regime: "These structures developed under a system of repression and and as a result were typified by inflexibility and difficulty in cooperatin with the new government" [1918]. Uganda: established a completely new political and bureaucratic apparatus, built from grassroots up.

3. Health Care infrastructure: SA has a well-developed sector, and so "was conducive to health interventions requiring standardised protocols and adequate supplies." Uganda had a much more difficult and ad hoc system, "could not easily support such interventions, instead being susceptible to independent service provision and variability in approaches on the ground."

4. Donor and NGO relations: SA; NGOs did not play a strong role in the initial AIDS policy development, and the government has been especially touchy about criticism. Also linkages to the medicalizzed pop control program of the aprtheid regime. Uganda: Much greater relation with the international NGO and IO community for both funding and projects/services. As result, there was opp for variation and experimentation.

	Abstract = {The popular press, policy officials, and academic publications increasingly warn of the negative effects on national security of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes it.  Despite these increasingly vocal pleas, however, the idea that HIV/AIDS erodes national security has not become conventional wisdom within the international relations discipline.  In this paper, we empirically test the link between HIV/AIDS and two aspects of national security, the severity of human rights abuses and civil conflict. Specifically, we examine the direct and indirect effects of adult HIV infection rates in 1999 and 2001 across 112 countries on the likelihood and intensity of state-imposed human rights violations and civil conflict.  We find that as HIV/AIDS prevalence rates increase, so too does the severity of human rights abuses and civil conflict.  HIV/AIDS has no direct impact on such abuses and civil conflict, however.  Rather, it influences national security indirectly through its 
impact on the social, political, and economic institutions of the state. },

@article{peyron1997a,
	Abstract = {This study was designed to evaluate drug use and drug costs of treatment of 1112 AIDS patients at the Infectious Diseases Unitat F. Houphou{\'e}t Boigny Hospital in Marseilles, France, between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 1994. All drug expenditures directly or indirectly related to AIDS treatment were recorded for both inpatients and outpatients. There were 1952 hospital stays. For each stay baseline characteristics including age, sex, risk factors, costs, and duration of hospitalization were noted. Patients were mainly young male drug addicts around thirty years of age. Reason for admission was also noted. The overall number of admissions per year has decreased since 1991 probably due to development of outpatient care. The number of stays per patient per year has decreased since 1993 because of the use of more appropriate therapeutic and prophylactic protocols. The number of drugs used was high increasing from 750 in 1990 to 868 in 1994. Cost of treatment doubled between 1 1994 due to the introduction of many expensive new drugs. Closer analysis showed that the greatest increase in expenditure involved 'antibiotic/antiviral', 'psychiatry/neurology' and 'specialized therapy'. Although not frequently prescribed, costly drugs such as immunoglobulins, hematopoietic growth factors, and parenteral nutrition solutions accounted for a high proportion of total costs. Since AZT, ddI and ddC were used mainly for outpatient treatment, their cost was low in inpatients. Cytomegalovirus-related retinitis, tuberculosis, and multiple infections were cost-intensive complications. The increasing number of cytomegalovirus infections underlines the need for cost evaluation and surveillance of this complication. This study demonstrates that cost of treating AIDS patients is rising due to the use of more and costlier drugs. This finding underlines the need to evaluate and compare new therapeutic modalities in terms of cost effectiveness.},

As was hypothesized, relationships among the members of the groups in the more mechanistic organization were seen as more formal at all levels of the hierarchy, all groups saw themselves as having less autonomy, and the organizational climate was seen as being oriented toward rules and conventionality. Unexpectedly, however, the organizational climate was also seen as developmental, generating at group level greater involvement of managers with the group. The multidimensionality of concepts such as organizational structure and climate is noted, and the complexity of the interrelationships among the various dimensions of these two concepts is stressed.},

	Abstract = {Initial sociological interest in network forms of organization was motivated in part by a critique of economic views of organization. Sociologists sought to highlight the prevalence and functionality of organizational forms that could not be classified as markets or hierarchies. As a result of this work, we now know that network forms of organization foster learning, represent a mechanism for the attainment of status or legitimacy, provide a variety of economic benefits, facilitate the management of resource dependencies, and provide considerable autonomy for employees. However, as sociologists move away from critiquing what are now somewhat outdated economic views, they need to balance the exclusive focus on prevalence and functionality with attention to constraint and dysfunctionality. The authors review work that has laid a foundation for this broader focus and suggest analytical concerns that should guide this literature as it moves forward.},

	Abstract = {New concepts regarding the medical care of AIDS patients are described in this paper. Currently, new pharmacologic agents and their combinations with zidovudine are being evaluated in clinical trials to determine their efficacy in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. Nevertheless, zidovudine is still the mainstay of therapy in AIDS patients. Significant findings regarding monotherapy, combination therapy, and immunotherapy for the treatment of HIV infection are also discussed. There is considerable controversy on the optimal time to initiate therapy with antiretroviral agents. The clinician's decision to initiate antiretroviral therapy should consider the expectations of patients in the context of relative benefits and potential toxicities of therapy. The clinician must be aware that rigid universal therapy guidelines for all patients may not be appropriate. Currently available drugs are only palliative and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for early intervention is indispensable on the basis of recent knowledge of the extremely complex pathogenesis of HIV infection. At present time, the medical care of AIDS patients should be individualized and done in the context of the patient-physician relationship for therapeutic and nontherapeutic decisions.},

@article{poteete2003,
	Abstract = {Recent work in international studies and comparative politics scrutinizes the relative importance of ideas, interests, and institutions as sources of policy change. A growing body of scholarship identifies ideas as the main causal factors, influencing perceived interests as well as perceived policy options. Others contend that policies can best be understood as products of institutions. Neither explanation can account for both policy choice by politicians and the implementation strategies of administrators. In Botswana, the use of professional criteria for hiring and advancement encourages adherence to international professional norms within the bureaucracy, but electoral competition gives politicians more reason to be attentive to local political concerns. The institutions that define relations of authority among actors with different motivations shape the outcomes of policy choice and implementation. Institutions influence the attentiveness of policy-makers to ideas when making decisions, the degree of attention particular policy-makers give to ideas from particular sources, and the degree of acceptance that ideas must achieve to affect policy. Better evaluations of political development can be achieved through attentiveness to the mix of actors involved in policy decisions, the diversity of institutions and ideas that affect their policy preferences, and the relations of authority that shape their relative influence over policy choice and implementation.},

	Abstract = {The African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnerships (ACHAP) played a major role in initiating Botswana's antiretroviral (ARV) program in 2001. ACHAP is a prominent public-private partnership involving Merck and its foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the government of Botswana. This paper analyzes ACHAP's efforts to assist Botswana with its ARV program, the first and most advanced in sub-Saharan Africa. It identifies five features of the model and shows how they contributed to the ARV program. It also raises questions about ACHAP's role in scaling up and sustaining the program, as Botswana faces the challenges of treating growing numbers of HIV-infected people.},

	Abstract = {The study of organizations is rife with competing vocabularies and perspectives. Taking a specific and traditional focus - organizational structure - the authors argue for a more unified theoretical and methodological analysis that is adequate at the levels of meaning and causality. They break with the typical conception of structures as a formal framework counterposed to the interactive patterns of organizational members. Drawing upon Bourdieu and Giddens, they stress the way structures are continually produced and recreated by members so that the structures embody and become constitutive of their provinces of meaning. Such an analysis must incorporate not only relations of meaning and power but also the mediation of contingent size, technology, and environment. The creativity of members in the face of contextual constraint can only be assessed by setting the analysis in a temporal, historical dimension.},

@article{reimann1973a,
	Abstract = {The results of a comparative study of 19 United States manufacturing organizations using the Aston group's four abbreviated structural scales and seven other measures support the concept of a multidimensional bureaucratic structure space. Factor and cluster analyses yielded three independent dimensions of decentralization, specialization, and formalization. The results are interpreted to suggest not only that a multidimensional model of bureaucracy is superior to the unidimensional Weberian one, but that the dimensionality of the bureaucratic structure space may be a function of the socio-cultural environment of the organization unit being examined. The results imply that bureaucratic structure may conform to the equifinality principle, in that a variety of structural arrangements appear to be equally viable strategies for the various sample organizations.},

@article{reiter1994,
	Abstract = {    This article presents and tests a theory of learning in international politics. Drawing primarily from social psychology and organization theory, the learning theory proposes that lessons tend to be drawn only from high-impact events in world politics, such as large wars and economic depressions. Lessons drawn tend to be simple and are oriented around the question of which policies are likely to be successful and which policies are likely to fail. This learning theory is tested on the alliance choices of small powers in the twentieth century. The predictions of two learning hypotheses are compared with those of a leading realist explanation of alliance choices, balance of threat theory. Quantitative analysis of small powers' alliance choices reveals that a small power's experience in the previous world war is a very powerful explanation of its peacetime alliance choices after that war, whereas the level of threat in the international environment has only marginal effects on the small power's alliance choices. Further, these threat effects may be in the opposite direction of that predicted by balance of threat theory.},

This paper presents the lessons learned, a discussion of obstacles and mistakes, and the different evaluation methods which have been used in CONASIDA'S mass media communication strategies and their results. Knowing the opinion of some clue informants was considered relevant--taking into account that evaluations were made by and at CONASIDA--and seven in-depth interviews were conducted among intellectuals, non-governmental organizations (NGO) leaders and public opinion leaders. The importance of society's involvement in AIDS prevention is stated, and two examples of mass media campaigns developed by civil groups are commented. A section about the importance of research as a requisite to produce preventive messages is included, along with some examples. Finally, some conclusions are presented, useful to us, as well as others, in developing new educational campaigns.},

@article{rio-zolezzi1995a,
	Abstract = {This study presents an analysis of AIDS cases and seroprevalence of HIV infection among Mexican women, from the onset of the epidemic through June 1994, as well as the analysis of the social and cultural factors that put women in a powerless situation regarding the adoption of preventive measures. Since 1985, when the first AIDS cases among women were reported in Mexico and until June 1, 1994, a total of 2,767 cases have been reported, representing 14.8% of the total number of cases. The first cases of AIDS among women were associated to infected blood transfusions; however, in 1986, heterosexually transmitted cases began to appear. Currently, only 35% of newly reported AIDS cases are associated to blood transfusions while 64% of them are related to heterosexual transmission. In fact, two epidemics are evident: one transmitted through blood, showing a downward trend (duplication time 45 months), and a second one, heterosexually transmitted, increasing twice as fast (duplication time 27 months). The latter is expected to dominate AIDS epidemiology among women in the future. In general, women are more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS biologically, but also socially and culturally. Women's economic, social and cultural subordination to their sexual partners results in a situation that makes it difficult for them to assess their infection risk and even more, to negotiate taking preventive measures. This situation is even more disadvantageous to rural women and, together with the recent trend of the AIDS epidemic to ruralization and with internal and international migration (temporary work force migration to the USA), can result in deep demographic and social effects. We conclude that it is necessary to work on the design and assessment of preventive measures under women's control, that empower them to protect themselves even without their partner's awareness. Also, it is necessary to promote sexual education among young heterosexual couples on how to talk about sexual issues and negotiate the use of preventive measure according to their actual sexual practices.},

@article{sell2004,
	Abstract = { Whose ideas matter? And how do actors make them matter? Focusing on the strategic deployment of competing normative frameworks, that is, framing issues and grafting private agendas on policy debates, we examine the contentious politics of the contemporary international intellectual property rights regime. We compare the business victory in the establishment of the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property (TRIPS) in the World Trade Organization with the subsequent NGO campaign against enforcing TRIPS to ensure access to essential HIV/AIDS medicines. Our analysis challenges constructivist scholarship that emphasizes the distinction between various types of transnational networks based on instrumental versus normative orientations. We question the portrayal of business firms as strictly instrumental actors preoccupied with material concerns, and NGOs as motivated solely by principled, or non-material beliefs. Yet we also offer a friendly amendment to constructivism by demonstrating its applicability to the analysis of business. Treating the business and NGO networks as competing interest groups driven by their normative ideals and material concerns, we demonstrate that these networks' strategies and activities are remarkably similar. },

	Abstract = {This study presents blood-associated AIDS epidemic trends in Mexico, including cases due to blood transfusions, cases in professional blood donors and hemophiliacs. We present also an overview of preventive measures--both legal and educative--undertaken to prevent this type of transmission and its effects on the epidemic. The first blood-associated AIDS cases in Mexico were reported in 1985, since then and up to July 1, 1994 a total of 1,728 adult cases and 116 pediatric cases have been reported (12.3\% and 25\% of the total cases, respectively). As in many other parts in the world, in Mexico women were markedly affected by this form of transmission; the women to men morbidity ratio is 1.35. Another group particularly affected by AIDS in Mexico are professional blood donors, who were infected because of improper management and recycling of blood transfusion centers bank materials such as plasmapheresis sets, in some blood transfusion centers in our country. Blood screening is mandatory for all blood donors in Mexico since May, 1986. A year later blood commercialization was banned because of the extremely high HIV infection prevalences found in some professional blood donors (7.2\%). Since that time a whole set of preventive measures has been implemented in our country, including blood quality and safety control as well as educative interventions. Results of these measures began to become evident by the end of 1991, when newly reported blood associated AIDS cases started to decrease, as opposed to their continuous growth seen in previous years. Up to July 1, 1994 we estimate that a total of 2,750 AIDS cases have been prevented through these measures, recovering an average of 36 years of potential life for each of them. Although blood transmission preventive measures have rendered significant achievements, we still have to face some very complex challenges such as potential ruralization of the epidemic and its impact on HIV infection prevalences among potential blood donors and therefore the need to ensure blood screening in rural areas.},

@article{shadlen2007,
	Abstract = { This article examines the relationship between intellectual property (IP) and public health, with a focus on the extension of AIDS treatment in the developing world. While most of the literature on IP and health examines the conditions affecting poor countries capacities to acquire essential medicines, I show the distinct-and more complicated-political economy of production and supply. IP regulations alter the structure of generic pharmaceutical sectors in the countries capable of supplying essential medicines, and changes in market structure affect actors economic and political interests and capacities. These new constellations of interests and capacities have profound implications for the creation and maintenance of political coalitions in support of on-going drug supply. The result is that the global AIDS treatment campaign becomes marked by mismatches of interests and capacities: those actors capable of taking the economic, legal, and political steps necessary to increase the supply and availability of essential drugs have diminished interest in doing so, and those actors with an interest in expanding treatment may lack the capacities to address the problem of undersupply. By focusing centrally on actors interests in and capacities for economic and political action, the article restores political economy to analysis of an issue-area that has been dominated by attention to international law. And by examining the fragility of the coalitions supporting the production and supply of generic drugs, the article points to the limits of transnational activist networks as enduring agents of change. },

	Abstract = {Early medical intervention in patients with HIV infection is beneficial even in asymptomatic individuals. Medical care in these patients consists of the use of antiretroviral drugs, drugs to prevent opportunistic infections, vaccines and comprehensive psychosocial support. It is important to determine the stage of the natural history of the disease at any given moment. Besides clinical data, the determination of CD4+ T-lymphocytes is useful to make decisions related to the institution of antiretroviral drugs and preventive therapy for opportunistic infections. Present evidence shows a clear benefit of starting antiretroviral drugs in every patient with AIDS or AIDS related complex and also supports the use of these drugs in early stages of the disease. Preventive therapy against Pneumocystis carinii has to be instituted in every patient with CD4 lymphocyte counts below 200/mm3. Prophylactic therapy may also be necessary to prevent tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis and M. avium. It is likely that future studies will show some benefit with the use of additional preventive strategies for other frequent infections such as Cytomegalovirus and Cryptosporidium.},

	Abstract = {Political scientists, sociologists, and economists have all sought to ana- 
lyze the spread of economic and political liberalism across countries in recent decades+ 
This ar ticle documents this diffusion of liberal policies and politics and proposes 
four distinct theories to explain how the prior choices of some countries and inter- 
national actors affect the subsequent behavior of others: coercion, competition, learn- 
ing, and emulation+ These theories are explored empirically in the symposium ar ticles 
that follow+ The goal of the symposium is to bring quite different and often isolated 
schools of thought into contact and communication with one another, and to define 
common metrics by which we can judge the utility of the contending approaches to 
diffusion across different policy domains+

	Abstract = {The nucleotide sequence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) gp120 variable region (V3) was obtained by sequencing the product of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of seven HIV-1 Mexican isolates from patients who had been infected either sexually or through blood products. Mexican isolates showed a 61.4% homology between them and three viral subtypes were demonstrated. One of these corresponds to three sexually infected patients, another to two hemophiliac patients infected through blood products or transfusions and the third subtype to either sexually or blood infected patients. The latter shows a great similarity to the HTLV-IIIb/LAV prototype strain. Antigenic profiles of this region show at least three neutralization patterns for these isolates as well as one virus that does not have a high predictive value epitope in the V3 region. Our data show that Mexico has a high heterogeneity of HIV-1 circulating strains, similar to that reported in other regions of the world.},

	Abstract = {Conflict, displacement, food insecurity and poverty make affected populations more vulnerable to HIV transmission. However, the common assumption that this vulnerability necessarily translates into more HIV infections and consequently fuels the HIV/AIDS epidemic is not supported by data. Whether or not conflict and displacement affect HIV transmission depends upon numerous competing and interacting factors. This paper explores and explains the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in conflict and addresses the unique characteristics that must be addressed when planning and implementing HIV/AIDS interventions among populations affected by conflict as compared with those in resource-poor settings. These include targeting at-risk groups, protection, programming strategies, coordination and integration and monitoring and evaluation. Areas for future HIV/AIDS operational research in conflict are discussed.},

Summary 
Background: Violence and rape are believed to fuel the HIV epidemic in countries aff ected by confl ict. We compared 
HIV prevalence in populations directly aff ected by confl ict with that in those not directly aff ected and in refugees 
versus the nearest surrounding host communities in sub-Saharan African countries. 

Methods: Seven countries aff ected by confl ict (Democratic Republic of Congo, southern Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda, 
Sierra Leone, Somalia, and Burundi) were chosen since HIV prevalence surveys within the past 5 years had been 
done and data, including original antenatal-care sentinel surveillance data, were available. We did a systematic and 
comprehensive literature search using Medline and Embase. Only articles and reports that contained original data for 
prevalence of HIV infection were included. All survey reports were independently evaluated by two epidemiologists 
to assess internationally accepted guidelines for HIV sentinel surveillance and population-based surveys. Whenever 
possible, data from the nearest antenatal care and host country sentinel site of the neighbouring countries were 
presented. 95% CIs were provided when available. 

Findings: Of the 295 articles that met our search criteria, 88 had original prevalence data and 65 had data from the 
seven selected countries. Data from these countries did not show an increase in prevalence of HIV infection during 
periods of confl ict, irrespective of prevalence when confl ict began. Prevalence in urban areas aff ected by confl ict 
decreased in Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda at similar rates to urban areas unaff ected by confl ict in their respective 
countries. Prevalence in confl ict-aff ected rural areas remained low and fairly stable in these countries. Of the 12 sets 
of refugee camps, nine had a lower prevalence of HIV infection, two a similar prevalence, and one a higher prevalence 
than their respective host communities. Despite wide-scale rape in many countries, there are no data to show that 
rape increased prevalence of HIV infection at the population level. 

Interpretation: We have shown that there is a need for mechanisms to provide time-sensitive information on the eff ect 
of confl ict on incidence of HIV infection, since we found insuffi  cient data to support the assertions that confl ict, 
forced displacement, and wide-scale rape increase prevalence or that refugees spread HIV infection in host 
communities.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Botswana was the first African country to introduce routine HIV testing (RHT). OBJECTIVE: To report program data for the first 2.5 years of RHT. METHODS: RHT was introduced in 2004. Rapid HIV tests were introduced later the same year and are widely available. The main criteria for RHT are symptoms of HIV/AIDS, pregnancy, sexually transmitted infection, and attendance for medical examination. Testing may also be self-initiated. FINDINGS: There has been a rapid scale-up of RHT. A total of 60,846 persons were tested through RHT in 2004 versus 157,894 in 2005 and 88,218 in the first half of 2006. Testing rates in the population through RHT were 40 per 1000 persons, 93 per 1000 persons, and 104 per 1000 persons, respectively. In 2005, 89% of those offered testing accepted, with 69% of those tested being female and 31% male. The proportion of men who tested HIV-positive was 34% versus 30% for women. The main reasons for testing in 2005 were patient's wish (50%), pregnancy (25%), medical examination (7%), clinical suspicion (6%), and sexually transmitted infection (2%). Attendance at voluntary counseling and testing centers has increased parallel to the scale-up of RHT. CONCLUSIONS: RHT has been widely accepted by the population, and no adverse effects or instances have been reported. It has provided increased access to preventive services and earlier assessment for antiretroviral treatment. We believe the benefits of RHT clearly outweigh the risks.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study uses surveillance, survey and program data to estimate past trends and current levels of HIV in Botswana and the effects of treatment and prevention programs. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data from sentinel surveillance at antenatal clinics and a national population survey were used to estimate the trend of adult HIV prevalence from 1980 to 2007. Using the prevalence trend we estimated the number of new adult infections, the transmission from mothers to children, the need for treatment and the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and adult and child deaths. Prevalence has declined slowly in urban areas since 2000 and has remained stable in rural areas. National prevalence is estimated at 26% (25-27%) in 2007. About 330,000 (318,000-335,000) people are infected with HIV including 20,000 children. The number of new adult infections has been stable for several years at about 20,000 annually (12,000-26,000). The number of new child infections has declined from 4600 in 1999 to about 890 (810-980) today due to nearly complete coverage of an effective program to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). The annual number of adult deaths has declined from a peak of over 15,500 in 2003 to under 7400 (5000-11,000) today due to coverage of ART that reaches over 80% in need. The need for ART will increase by 60% by 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Botswana's PMTCT and treatment programs have achieved significant results in preventing new child infections and deaths among adults and children. The number of new adult infections continues at a high level. More effective prevention efforts are urgently needed.},

	Abstract = {Since 1987 The National AIDS Council in Mexico (CONASIDA), has conducted research projects among female commercial sex workers (CSW), who are seen at the AIDS Information Centers. Through these studies, we have been able to find out how different issues influence commercial sex work in Mexico City. Since the beginning of our own studies in 1989, HIV prevalence in this particular group has remained low (0.04%-0.2%). Factors found to be associated with condom use were: educational level, not having children, more experience in sex work and younger age. Condom use was reported by 88% of the women; however, qualitative information and high STD prevalence rates suggest a much lower condom use. Mandatory HIV testing is not useful as a preventive measure among sex workers. Persuasive and structural interventions must be implemented in accordance with local and legal situations.},

	Annote = {The API was developed by UNAIDS, USAID, and the Policy Project to measure programme effort in the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is designed to provide a current profile of national effort and a measure of change over time. The API was first applied to 40 countries in 2000, and a revised index was applied in 54 countries in early 2003.

Results of the 2003 round include:

    * programme effort is relatively high in the areas of political support, policies, and planning with average scores above 70% of the maximum effort
    * prevention programmes and the legal and regulatory environment are the next most highly rated components with scores between 60% and 70%
    * the human rights component received the lowest score
    * respondents reported that legal structures are in place to protect human rights but that resources and enforcement efforts are lacking
    * resource availability and mitigation effort also received low scores
    * by region, Eastern and Southern Africa has the highest overall scores
    * West and Central Africa and Asia also scored relatively high, with Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern Europe somewhat lower
    * the average score for all countries increased slightly from 56% in 2000 to 61% in 2003
    * the largest increases were for political support, resources, and care and treatment

Conclusions from the survey include:

    * all countries have some organised effort to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic
    * most countries have good policies and organisational structures in place
    * the weakest areas are in the implementation of the policies and plans
    * countries with the strongest effort, such as Brazil, Senegal, Thailand, and Uganda, all have strong political commitment and a national consensus that lead to significant effort to implement comprehensive programs},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to analyze the HIV/AIDS magnitude, distribution, frequency, patterns, trends, risk factors, risk groups, estimation and evaluation of interventions in Mexico during the last twelve years. Results of a summary of statistics and results from several sources are presented including the National Registry of AIDS cases, HIV sentinel surveillance in 18 cities of the country, analysis of death certificates, cross-sectional, longitudinal, observational, and intervention studies. As of March 1995, 34,230 AIDS cases, 120,000 HIV infections and 21,000 AIDS deaths are estimated. A damaged exponential growth with duplication of AIDS cases every 18 months can be seen. Epidemiological patterns of transmission are found primarily among men with homosexual and bisexual practices. The male:female ratio is 6 to 1. In 1992 AIDS was the 19th cause of death among the general population. At least two patterns of transmission have been identified: one is the western-urban pattern which contributes with more than 90% of cases and the other, more recent, has been described as Caribbean-rural. Blood transmission of AIDS shows a downward trend, and heterosexual and perinatal transmission is slightly increasing. Seroprevalence among adults is 0.06%: however, among groups with risk practices, rates up to 50% have been found. Risk factors are similar to those described in the literature in other countries, and have been used for designing interventions. Evaluation of interventions has been accomplished by demonstrating positive results in the prevention of blood transmission and sexual transmission among female commercial sex workers; prevention efforts directed to men with homosexual practices have not been successful. Between 77,000 and 88,000 cumulated AIDS cases are estimated in Mexico for the year 2000.},

	Abstract = {Studies on sexually transmitted diseases (STD) during the previous years in Mexico are discussed. The information sources were: a) Surveys among commercial sex workers. Since 1990, 1,386 women have been studied in four federal states through structured questionnaires and laboratory tests. Prevalence of different STD's has been significant (syphilis (VDRL, FTA-abs) 23.7%; chlamydiosis (Ag IF) 12.9%; gonorrhea (Ag, ELISA) 11.5%; anti-HBs 11.0%; herpes 1,2 (IgM) 9.3%, HBsAg 5.7%. Frequency of HIV (ELISA, Western blot) has been low; 0.5%. In 1994, 662 women were studied in Mexico City, with different laboratory techniques for chlamydiosis and gonorrhea (culture), hepatitis B (anticore antibodies) and herpes (total antibodies) with the following results: syphilis 1.5-12%; chlamydiosis 10.8-11.7%; gonorrhea 0-5.9%; hepatitis B 0-7.1%; herpes 44.7-78%; and HIV 0-1.4%. b) Surveys among men with homosexual and bisexual practices. 325 subjects have been studied in three federal states using methods similar to those of the 1990 survey. Contrasting with results among women, HIV prevalence was found to be high; (18.8%), and considerable for other STD's: anti-HBsAg 28.6%, syphilis 34.9%, recent herpes 10.9%, HBsAg 5.0%, chlamydiosis (Ag, IF) 4.3%, herpes simplex 1,2 (Ag, IF) 4.7%, gonorrhea (Ag, ELISA) 2.8%. c) Patient clinical studies. The clinical interrelationship between different STD and HIV infection has been studied; clinical differences are described between patients with condylomata or syphilis depending on HIV serostatus. Implications of the interrelationship between different STD's and HIV infection for the prevention and control of these diseases are discussed.},

	Abstract = {By December 1993, more than 17,000 AIDS cases had been reported in Mexico and some estimates indicate approximately 100,000 individuals currently infected with HIV. From the patient's perspective, being HIV positive or having AIDS, places an enormous burden on psychosocial coping mechanisms. Thus, psychosocial support is required for all of these patients. This paper summarizes our educational intervention on counseling techniques and provides information of our demonstration project on the effectiveness of the educational intervention among 89 Mexican health care workers. Overall, these professionals showed improvement in their knowledge and goals of providing counseling. One of the more striking was the discovery of homophobic attitudes among them, particularly those with no previous experience in the care of HIV infected people. This exploratory study allowed us to identify research and educational needs of health care workers. The overwhelming number of estimated cases of HIV infections and the current trends of the epidemic reveal the necessity for training in medical counseling that over 73,000 physicians in Mexico will face in the immediate future.},

	Abstract = {The South African government's open challenging of the international AIDS control regime presents a paradox for the study of international regimes and epistemic communities: why would a state that would presumably benefit the most from a regime not only refuse to adhere to its precepts, but openly challenge its basic tenets? I argue that a fundamental disjuncture exists between the identity commitments of the international AIDS control regime and South Africa's identity, and that this disjuncture is rooted in the country's negative past experiences with public health interventions and the attempts to forge a new, African Renaissance-inspired self-identity. This disjuncture finds its expression through the development of a counter-epistemic community which offers scientific expertise and policy recommendations to the South African government. The counter-epistemic community offers a mechanism for the South African government to engage the international AIDS control regime.},
