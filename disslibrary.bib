	Abstract = {This paper addresses hierarchical models with continuous dependent variables, such as time- series cross-section models. Building on the argument in Zorn (2001), the main point of this paper is that the pooled OLS estimator is deeply flawed -- especially for time-series cross-section data -- but for reasons that have not explicitly been raised in previous papers. The pooled OLS estimator, the within-estimator, the between-estimator, and the random effects estimator can be seen as special cases of the fractionally pooled estimator presented in Bartels (1996), which allows all of these estimators to be evaluated in a common framework. Taking bias and efficiency into account, using both the within estimator and the between estimator is likely to be the best estimation strategy for the vast majority of applications in political science.},

@article{polodny1998a,
	Abstract = {Initial sociological interest in network forms of organization was motivated in part by a critique of economic views of organization. Sociologists sought to highlight the prevalence and functionality of organizational forms that could not be classified as markets or hierarchies. As a result of this work, we now know that network forms of organization foster learning, represent a mechanism for the attainment of status or legitimacy, provide a variety of economic benefits, facilitate the management of resource dependencies, and provide considerable autonomy for employees. However, as sociologists move away from critiquing what are now somewhat outdated economic views, they need to balance the exclusive focus on prevalence and functionality with attention to constraint and dysfunctionality. The authors review work that has laid a foundation for this broader focus and suggest analytical concerns that should guide this literature as it moves forward.},

	Abstract = {Conflict, displacement, food insecurity and poverty make affected populations more vulnerable to HIV transmission. However, the common assumption that this vulnerability necessarily translates into more HIV infections and consequently fuels the HIV/AIDS epidemic is not supported by data. Whether or not conflict and displacement affect HIV transmission depends upon numerous competing and interacting factors. This paper explores and explains the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in conflict and addresses the unique characteristics that must be addressed when planning and implementing HIV/AIDS interventions among populations affected by conflict as compared with those in resource-poor settings. These include targeting at-risk groups, protection, programming strategies, coordination and integration and monitoring and evaluation. Areas for future HIV/AIDS operational research in conflict are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnerships (ACHAP) played a major role in initiating Botswana's antiretroviral (ARV) program in 2001. ACHAP is a prominent public-private partnership involving Merck and its foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the government of Botswana. This paper analyzes ACHAP's efforts to assist Botswana with its ARV program, the first and most advanced in sub-Saharan Africa. It identifies five features of the model and shows how they contributed to the ARV program. It also raises questions about ACHAP's role in scaling up and sustaining the program, as Botswana faces the challenges of treating growing numbers of HIV-infected people.},

	Abstract = {
There are fundamental differences in the epidemiological patterns of AIDS in Africa and the United States. A number of theories have been advanced to explain these differences. These theories may be divided into two basic approaches, theories based upon biological explanations and theories based upon social explanations. Biological based theories include a socio-biological explanation and a natural history explanation. The social theories may be divided into three theories which are historical/materialist in their explanation of AIDS in Africa and one theory which is primarily idealist and cultural in its explanation. The present article critically examines these biological and social theories. It argues that the biological theories lack scientific support, lack sufficient evidential support, have an inequality of cause and effect, and fail to integrate the micro/macro. This article argues that the social theories also have some major difficulties including, in some cases, a failure to integrate the micro/macro and a lack of adequate or sufficient causation to produce the massive epidemic of AIDS in Africa. There are difficulties with the quality of evidence and support for the social theories and more research needs to be conducted, particularly in the form of retrospective studies, to determine the validity of various social theories which attempt to explain the epidemiological patterns of the AIDS epidemic in Africa.},

@article{steen2007a,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Botswana was the first African country to introduce routine HIV testing (RHT). OBJECTIVE: To report program data for the first 2.5 years of RHT. METHODS: RHT was introduced in 2004. Rapid HIV tests were introduced later the same year and are widely available. The main criteria for RHT are symptoms of HIV/AIDS, pregnancy, sexually transmitted infection, and attendance for medical examination. Testing may also be self-initiated. FINDINGS: There has been a rapid scale-up of RHT. A total of 60,846 persons were tested through RHT in 2004 versus 157,894 in 2005 and 88,218 in the first half of 2006. Testing rates in the population through RHT were 40 per 1000 persons, 93 per 1000 persons, and 104 per 1000 persons, respectively. In 2005, 89% of those offered testing accepted, with 69% of those tested being female and 31% male. The proportion of men who tested HIV-positive was 34% versus 30% for women. The main reasons for testing in 2005 were patient's wish (50%), pregnancy (25%), medical examination (7%), clinical suspicion (6%), and sexually transmitted infection (2%). Attendance at voluntary counseling and testing centers has increased parallel to the scale-up of RHT. CONCLUSIONS: RHT has been widely accepted by the population, and no adverse effects or instances have been reported. It has provided increased access to preventive services and earlier assessment for antiretroviral treatment. We believe the benefits of RHT clearly outweigh the risks.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Male circumcision is known to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV, but few studies have been performed to assess its acceptability among either children or adults in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional survey in nine geographically representative locations in Botswana to determine the acceptability of male circumcision in the country, as well as the preferred age and setting for male circumcision. Interviews were conducted using standardised questionnaires both before and after an informational session outlining the risks and benefits of male circumcision. RESULTS: Among 605 people surveyed, the median age was 29 years (range 18-74 years), 52% were male, and >15 ethnicities were represented. Before the informational session, 408 (68%) responded that they would definitely or probably circumcise a male child if circumcision was offered free of charge in a hospital setting; this number increased to 542 (89%) after the informational session. Among 238 uncircumcised men, 145 (61%) stated that they would definitely or probably get circumcised themselves if it were offered free of charge in a hospital setting; this increased to 192 (81%) after the informational session. In a multivariate analysis of all participants, people with children were more likely to favour circumcision than people without children (adjusted odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.4). Most participants (55%) felt that the ideal age for circumcision is before 6 years, and 90% of participants felt that circumcision should be performed in the hospital setting. CONCLUSIONS: Male circumcision appears to be highly acceptable in Botswana. The option for safe circumcision should be made available to parents in Botswana for their male children. Circumcision might also be an acceptable option for adults and adolescents, if its efficacy as an HIV prevention strategy among sexually active people is supported by clinical trials.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study uses surveillance, survey and program data to estimate past trends and current levels of HIV in Botswana and the effects of treatment and prevention programs. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data from sentinel surveillance at antenatal clinics and a national population survey were used to estimate the trend of adult HIV prevalence from 1980 to 2007. Using the prevalence trend we estimated the number of new adult infections, the transmission from mothers to children, the need for treatment and the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and adult and child deaths. Prevalence has declined slowly in urban areas since 2000 and has remained stable in rural areas. National prevalence is estimated at 26% (25-27%) in 2007. About 330,000 (318,000-335,000) people are infected with HIV including 20,000 children. The number of new adult infections has been stable for several years at about 20,000 annually (12,000-26,000). The number of new child infections has declined from 4600 in 1999 to about 890 (810-980) today due to nearly complete coverage of an effective program to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). The annual number of adult deaths has declined from a peak of over 15,500 in 2003 to under 7400 (5000-11,000) today due to coverage of ART that reaches over 80% in need. The need for ART will increase by 60% by 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Botswana's PMTCT and treatment programs have achieved significant results in preventing new child infections and deaths among adults and children. The number of new adult infections continues at a high level. More effective prevention efforts are urgently needed.},

	Abstract = {This article examines whether transnational networks reconfigure state-civil society relationships in ways that lead to civil society empowerment and increased organizational capacity to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Mexico. Using a comparative case study, I identify the types of transnational networks and exchanges that both help and hinder community-based HIV/AIDS organizations (CBOs) that provide AIDS prevention and treatment services in Tijuana and Mexico City. Data derive from over 50 formal interviews, organizational documents and archival records, and observation. I argue that the form and function of transnational networks is shaped by the geo-political context of local organizational fields and that, in turn, transnational networks provide innovative opportunities for civil society-state partnerships that favor some local organizations over others. Ultimately, I take apart the prevailing assumption that transnational networks are inherently good, and show how they can (re)produce inter-organizational stratification at the local level. The conclusions of this research are helpful to international health practitioners and social scientists seeking to understand how civil society's participation in transnational networks can both challenge and reproduce existing community-state power regimes and health inequities.},

@article{hernandez-tepichin2000a,
	Abstract = {The current total of AIDS cases in Mexico is 37,000 of which 86{\%} have occurred in men. The major route of transmission is sexual. The campaign to prevent AIDS has fallen into four phases, and has now been extended to other sexually transmitted diseases, including hepatitis B. The first phase (1985-1989) was based around question and answer brochures, which increased awareness but did not remove misconceptions. A mass media campaign addressed these misconceptions and stressed preventive measures. The campaign was halted by opposition to the promotion of condom use on the grounds that it encouraged promiscuity. The second phase (1989-1992) used more conservative messages, but these were too obscure and failed to reach the target audience. A poster campaign using popular lottery characters was widely accepted. In the third phase (1992-1994), a combination of messages was targeted at different populations, including parents and women, and general public sympathy for social support for people with AIDS was encouraged. In the fourth phase (1996-2000), a mass media campaign was aimed at teenagers, with parents and teachers as support groups. The campaign was widened to include HBV infection, and posters and brochures for teenagers were produced. These are distributed as part of a collaboration with non-governmental organizations providing sex education. The private medical sector is being encouraged to provide facilities for hepatitis B vaccination. So far the campaign has only been established in Mexico City, but it is hoped that this will be extended nationwide. Hepatitis B vaccination has been recently included in the National Immunization Programme for infants in the first year of life and it is officially recommended for at-risk populations.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of HIV/AIDS on economic growth and poverty in Botswana and estimate how providing treatment can mitigate its effects. METHODS: Demographic and financial projections were combined with economic simulation models, including a macroeconomic growth model and a macro-microeconomic computable general equilibrium and microsimulation model. RESULTS: HIV/AIDS significantly reduces economic growth and increases household poverty. The impact is now severe enough to be affecting the economy as a whole, and threatens to pull some of the uninfected population into poverty. Providing antiretroviral therapy can partly offset this negative effect. Treatment increases health's share of government expenditure only marginally, because it increases economic growth and because withholding treatment raises the cost of other health services. CONCLUSION: Botswana's treatment programme is appropriate from a macroeconomic perspective. Conducting macroeconomic impact assessments is important in countries where prevalence rates are particularly high.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This paper first presents the trend of HIV/AIDS expenditures in Mexico between 1997 and 2002. It then compares the allocation and magnitude of such expenditures within the international context and, in particular, how other countries in the region are allocating HIV/AIDS resources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 1997, Mexico has developed and been utilizing a method for systematically and comprehensively analyze national resource and expenditure flows for HIV/AIDS prevention and care; an exhaustive study known as the National AIDS Account. Results. During this five year period, a systematic increase in real expenditures occurred (143% increase in total), most of which was allocated to the purchase of drugs for antiretroviral treatment. Nevertheless, compared with other countries in the region, Mexican expenditures for HIV/AIDS are less biased in their allocation between prevention and treatment. DISCUSSION: Mexico is committed to ensure universal coverage of AIDS treatment while maintaining and even increasing prevention efforts. These activities demand increasing amounts of resources. It is, therefore, important to track how efficiently such resources are being used in order to improve allocation and targeting of health resources.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of the Mexican HIV/AIDS surveillance system between 1986 and 2001. DESIGN: All information was collected through an extensive literature search. METHODS: Databases such as the Mexican National AIDS Programmes RIMSIDA (Registry of Mexican AIDS Research), MedLINE, PopLine, and AIDSLINE were used. Databases, keywords, and MeSH headings to search were discussed and agreed upon before and during the literature search. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty articles and conference abstracts were reviewed and showed that the Mexican surveillance system has undergone many adaptations. The HIV/AIDS surveillance system began in 1986, when the focus was on identifying AIDS cases. This period was followed by special studies among risk groups, and served as the basis for the sentinel surveillance system that was adopted in 1990. The system now requires HIV and AIDS case reporting as well as sentinel surveillance. Mexico has also carried out the piloting of the behavioural surveillance component of Second Generation Surveillance. CONCLUSION: The Mexican experience illustrates how surveillance systems need to be dynamic in order to monitor trends in HIV over time. This review also demonstrates that middle-income countries can successfully implement surveillance systems. However, although Mexico has had many successes, a need exists to address issues that limit its ability to implement AIDS case and behavioural surveillance fully and consistently.},

	Abstract = {Botswana has the second highest HIV prevalence rate and highest rate of orphanhood in the world. Although child mortality rates have doubled in 15 years, the extent to which health disparities are connected to orphan status remains unclear. We conducted an analysis of the 2000 Botswana Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey to examine whether orphan-based health disparities exist. We measured health inequalities using anthropometric data among 2723 under-five year olds, nested in 1854 households, and 208 communities. We calculated multilevel logistic regression models to estimate the child, household, and regional determinants of growth failure. We found that orphaned children aged 0-4 are 49% more likely to be underweight than nonorphans (p<0.05) controlling for household poverty and other factors; and orphans disproportionately live in the poorest households. Throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Botswana is a leader in responding to the AIDS epidemic, in particular as one of the first countries to offer universal antiretroviral treatment. However, orphan-based health disparities confirm that the orphan response is still insufficient. Better data are needed to fully understand the mechanisms that lead to these disparities, and the public sector needs an increased capacity to fully implement the policies and programs designed to meet the needs of orphans. Findings from this study have important implications for countries throughout SSA, and Southern Africa in particular, where the number of orphans has doubled to tripled over the past 15 years.},

	Abstract = {National expenditures on HIV/AIDS were estimated as summary indicators to assess the country's response to HIV/AIDS. The methodology is based on a matrix system describing the level and flow of health expenditures on HIV/AIDS: an adaptation of the National Health Accounts methods. The expenditures were classified by source (public, private, international), by the use of funds (prevention, care), by object, and by type of provider institution. The results are reported in US dollars using the official exchange rate for the year of estimation. For international comparisons monetary units were adjusted by the purchasing power parity (US dollars PPP). National HIV/AIDS total expenditures were: Guatemala US dollars PPP29.5 million, Uruguay US dollars PPP 32.5 million, Mexico US dollars PPP 257 million, and Brazil US dollars PPP 587.4 million during 1998, and Honduras US dollars PPP 33.9 million for 1999. The total HIV/AIDS expenditures per capita for 1998 were: Brazil US dollars 2.69, Mexico US dollars 1.25, Guatemala US dollars 1.08, Uruguay US dollars 6.63, and Honduras US dollars 3.6 for 1999. The 1998 distribution of the total HIV/AIDS expenditures in prevention and care were, respectively, Brazil 10 and 80%, Guatemala 15 and 70%, Mexico 29 and 66%, Uruguay 36 and 51%, and Honduras 28 and 65% for 1999. The share of total expenditures on antiretroviral drugs ranged from 52% in Guatemala to 75% in Brazil, even when the estimated coverage of antiretroviral therapy was close to 10% in Guatemala and universal in Brazil. The estimated flow from international sources per capita in 1998 was Uruguay US dollars 0.03, Brazil US dollars 0.24, Guatemala US dollars 0.11, Mexico US dollars 0.01, and Honduras US dollars 1.04 in 1999. The data allow international comparisons and provide critical information to improve equity and efficiency in the allocation of scarce resources. The National HIV/AIDS Accounts also constitute a powerful tool to describe the country's response to HIV/AIDS.},

	Abstract = {This paper traces the development of policies dealing with HIV/AIDS in Botswana from their beginning in the late 1980s to the current programme to provide population-wide anti-retroviral therapy (ARV). Using a variety of source material, including long-term ethnographic research, it seeks to account for the failure of Western-inspired approaches in dealing with the pandemic. It does this by looking at the cultural and institutional features that have created resistance to the message and inhibited effective implementation. The negative response to the first educational campaign stressing condom use is described and contextualized in terms of Tswana ideas of morality and illness. Nor, as was initially expected, did the introduction of free ARV therapy operate to break the silence and stigma that had developed around the disease. Take-up was very slow, and did not operate to encourage widespread testing. In 2003, key policymakers in Botswana began to argue for a break with the AIDS 'exceptionalism' position, with its emphasis on voluntarism, confidentiality and the human rights of patients. This resulted in routine testing being introduced in 2004. This links to a major argument running through the paper which is that the failure of policy cannot be attributed solely to the nature of local populations. Western cultural assumptions about 'good practice' also require critical examination.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: In responding to the goal of rapidly increasing access to antiretroviral treatment (ART), the government of Botswana undertook a major review of its health systems options to increase access to human resources, one of the major bottlenecks preventing people from receiving treatment. In mid-2004, a team of government and World Health Organization (WHO) staff reviewed the situation and identified a number of public sector scale up options. The team also reviewed the capacity of private practitioners to participate in the provision of ART. Subsequently, the government created a mechanism to include private practitioners in rolling out ART. At the end of 2006, more than 4500 patients had been transferred to the private sector for routine follow up. It is estimated that the cooperation reduced the immediate need for recruiting up to 40 medically qualified staff into the public sector over the coming years, depending on the development of the national standard for the number and duration of patient visits to a doctor per year. Thus welcome relief was brought, while at the same time not exercising a pull factor on human resources for health in the sub-Saharan region.},

@periodical{altman1992a,
	Abstract = {The cost of treating people infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, is soaring, an international meeting on AIDS was told here today.

The lifetime cost of treating an AIDS patient in the United States is now $102,000, up from $85,333 in 1991, said Dr. Fred J. Hellinger, a Federal official who has been tracking the costs of caring for people infected with H.I.V. for the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, an arm of the Public Health Service. The figure was $57,000 in 1988.

The annual cost of treating an American AIDS patient is now $38,300 and the average cost of treating an H.I.V.-infected individual who has not yet developed AIDS is about $10,000, Dr. Hellinger said. A year ago, the estimated costs were $32,000 and $5,100, respectively.

By contrast, Americans' lifetime treatment cost is $52,000 for breast cancer and $175,000 for kidney failure. Lower Costs Elsewhere

The increase reflects a wide variety of new therapies that have been introduced to combat the virus, which weakens patients' immune systems, and the many other opportunistic infections that strike as a result. But while the treatments improve patients' quality of life, researchers debate whether the therapies have actually allowed them to live longer.

After a person is infected with H.I.V., the virus remains silent for many years, sometimes up to a decade. Then as the immune system breaks down, the virus causes the AIDS and a litany of health problems. Many of the recently developed therapies for H.I.V.-infected individuals are intended to delay the progression to AIDS.

Charles Cameron of the Harvard School of Public Health told the meeting that the amount spent per year on an AIDS patient was $22,300 in Western Europe, $2,000 in Latin America and $393 in African countries south of the Sahara.

Dr. Hellinger said the cumulative cost of caring for Americans with H.I.V. since AIDS was first diagnosed in 1981 would reach $15.2 billion by 1995.

The soaring costs in the United States were tracked through a Federal program analyzing the services used by 2,000 H.I.V.-infected people in 10 cities. Dr. Hellinger said he also used data from state officials in California, Florida, Hawaii and New York. Expensive Treatments

The marketing of new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration accounts for much of the rising costs, and many therapies also require monitoring with expensive laboratory tests. Among the recently marketed drugs for H.I.V. and AIDS patients that Dr. Hellinger cited were these:

*Didanosine (DDI) for treatment among individuals who cannot use AZT. A week's treatment costs $40.

*Erythropoietin to treat anemia at a cost of $200 per week.

*A drug to increase the number of white blood cells that is approved for treating cancer patients but that doctors prescribe for some H.I.V. patients. The cost is $1,000 a week.

*Drugs to treat opportunistic infections like cytomegalovirus (Acylovir) and fungi (Fluconazole).

One of the most expensive drugs is foscarnet, which is used to treat a blinding condition, retinitis, that is caused by cytomegalovirus. Act Up, an AIDS advocacy and protest group, says foscarnet costs more than $20,000 a year. Astra, the world's only manufacturer of foscarnet, says it offers a 15 percent discount on all its products, including foscarnet, to more than 1,600 community health centers and other groups that treat AIDS patients in the United States.

Act Up members knocked over Astra's booth in the convention hall here to protest the Swedish company's pricing of the drug. Challenging Other Theories

A Canadian study challenged claims that AIDS is caused by something other than H.I.V., as some critics have contended. Among the other possible causes the critics suggest are unusually high levels of sexual activity or use of psychoactive drugs.

Dr. Kevin J. P. Craib's team in Vancouver, British Columbia, studied more than 711 gay men. Of these, 350 never showed evidence of H.I.V., 237 were already infected when the study began in 1982 and 128 became infected afterward.

About half the uninfected men said they used psychoactive drugs and a quarter reported many instances of receptive anal intercourse with casual partners, a very high risk factor for AIDS.

Of 136 AIDS-related illnesses that developed in the closely monitored group, all occurred in men infected with H.I.V. None of the uninfected men showed evidence of abnormality in their immune system. The count for CD4 cells, a monitoring test for immune function, remained stable in the uninfected group but fell steadily in the infected groups.

Only two uninfected men died, one from a heart attack and the other by suicide. Of those infected throughout the study, 80 died of AIDS-related conditions, and of those who became infected, 21 died from such illnesses.

Scientists around the world continue to seek what additional factors might speed the progression of H.I.V. infection to AIDS. But the problem with AIDS is as it is for many other diseases. Scientists do not know why some people can smoke heavily and escape lung cancer or heart disease, while others who smoke less succumb to these and other tobacco-related conditions. Impact of Depression

In a surprising finding, Federal researchers analyzed five studies and found no increased risk of infection in the second of two children born to an H.I.V.-infected mother, regardless of whether the first-born was infected or uninfected. Many researchers had believed that there was an increased risk of infection for a second child.

Another study, from the University of California at San Francisco, found that the condition of H.I.V.-infected men who were also depressed, as measured by a standard diagnostic scale, declined more rapidly and death came sooner than in infected men who were not depressed. In the six-year study of 330 gay and bisexual men, monitoring tests showed that a type of white blood cell dropped 38 percent faster in those who were depressed than in those who were not.

About a third of the 330 men died, and the proportions were the same among those who were depressed and those who were not. But the depressed men were more likely to die faster.

"It is clear that depression is correlated with a worse prognosis in H.I.V. disease," said Dr. Jeffrey Burack, the principal author of the study. "We know that it is not just that people who are sicker become more depressed, since we measured depression before disease occurred."},

@article{peyron1997a,
	Abstract = {This study was designed to evaluate drug use and drug costs of treatment of 1112 AIDS patients at the Infectious Diseases Unitat F. Houphou{\'e}t Boigny Hospital in Marseilles, France, between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 1994. All drug expenditures directly or indirectly related to AIDS treatment were recorded for both inpatients and outpatients. There were 1952 hospital stays. For each stay baseline characteristics including age, sex, risk factors, costs, and duration of hospitalization were noted. Patients were mainly young male drug addicts around thirty years of age. Reason for admission was also noted. The overall number of admissions per year has decreased since 1991 probably due to development of outpatient care. The number of stays per patient per year has decreased since 1993 because of the use of more appropriate therapeutic and prophylactic protocols. The number of drugs used was high increasing from 750 in 1990 to 868 in 1994. Cost of treatment doubled between 1 1994 due to the introduction of many expensive new drugs. Closer analysis showed that the greatest increase in expenditure involved 'antibiotic/antiviral', 'psychiatry/neurology' and 'specialized therapy'. Although not frequently prescribed, costly drugs such as immunoglobulins, hematopoietic growth factors, and parenteral nutrition solutions accounted for a high proportion of total costs. Since AZT, ddI and ddC were used mainly for outpatient treatment, their cost was low in inpatients. Cytomegalovirus-related retinitis, tuberculosis, and multiple infections were cost-intensive complications. The increasing number of cytomegalovirus infections underlines the need for cost evaluation and surveillance of this complication. This study demonstrates that cost of treating AIDS patients is rising due to the use of more and costlier drugs. This finding underlines the need to evaluate and compare new therapeutic modalities in terms of cost effectiveness.},

Summary 
Background: Violence and rape are believed to fuel the HIV epidemic in countries aff ected by confl ict. We compared 
HIV prevalence in populations directly aff ected by confl ict with that in those not directly aff ected and in refugees 
versus the nearest surrounding host communities in sub-Saharan African countries. 

Methods: Seven countries aff ected by confl ict (Democratic Republic of Congo, southern Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda, 
Sierra Leone, Somalia, and Burundi) were chosen since HIV prevalence surveys within the past 5 years had been 
done and data, including original antenatal-care sentinel surveillance data, were available. We did a systematic and 
comprehensive literature search using Medline and Embase. Only articles and reports that contained original data for 
prevalence of HIV infection were included. All survey reports were independently evaluated by two epidemiologists 
to assess internationally accepted guidelines for HIV sentinel surveillance and population-based surveys. Whenever 
possible, data from the nearest antenatal care and host country sentinel site of the neighbouring countries were 
presented. 95% CIs were provided when available. 

Findings: Of the 295 articles that met our search criteria, 88 had original prevalence data and 65 had data from the 
seven selected countries. Data from these countries did not show an increase in prevalence of HIV infection during 
periods of confl ict, irrespective of prevalence when confl ict began. Prevalence in urban areas aff ected by confl ict 
decreased in Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda at similar rates to urban areas unaff ected by confl ict in their respective 
countries. Prevalence in confl ict-aff ected rural areas remained low and fairly stable in these countries. Of the 12 sets 
of refugee camps, nine had a lower prevalence of HIV infection, two a similar prevalence, and one a higher prevalence 
than their respective host communities. Despite wide-scale rape in many countries, there are no data to show that 
rape increased prevalence of HIV infection at the population level. 

Interpretation: We have shown that there is a need for mechanisms to provide time-sensitive information on the eff ect 
of confl ict on incidence of HIV infection, since we found insuffi  cient data to support the assertions that confl ict, 
forced displacement, and wide-scale rape increase prevalence or that refugees spread HIV infection in host 
communities.},

	Abstract = {Global poverty, economist Collier points out, is actually falling quite rapidly for about 80% of the world. The real crisis lies in a group of about 50 failing states, the bottom billion, whose problems defy traditional approaches to alleviating poverty. Here, Collier contends that these fifty failed states pose the central challenge of the developing world in the twenty-first century. This group of small nations, largely unnoticed by the industrialized West, are dropping further and further behind the majority of the world's people, often falling into an absolute decline in living standards. A struggle rages within each of these nation between reformers and corrupt leaders--and the corrupt are winning. Collier analyzes the causes of failure, and offers a bold new plan.--From publisher description},

520    $aGlobal poverty, economist Collier points out, is actually falling quite rapidly for about 80% of the world. The real crisis lies in a group of about 50 failing states, the bottom billion, whose problems defy traditional approaches to alleviating poverty. Here, Collier contends that these fifty failed states pose the central challenge of the developing world in the twenty-first century. This group of small nations, largely unnoticed by the industrialized West, are dropping further and further behind the majority of the world's people, often falling into an absolute decline in living standards. A struggle rages within each of these nation between reformers and corrupt leaders--and the corrupt are winning. Collier analyzes the causes of failure, and offers a bold new plan.--From publisher description.

	Abstract = {
Considerable interest has arisen in the role of governance or political commitment in determining the success or failure of HIV/AIDS policies in sub-Saharan Africa. During the 1990s, Uganda and South Africa both faced dramatic HIV/AIDS epidemics and also saw transformations to new political systems. However, their responses to the disease differed in many ways. This paper compares and contrasts the ways in which policy environments, particularly government structures, can impede or expedite implementation of effective HIV prevention. Four elements of these environments are discussed--the role of political leadership, the existing bureaucratic system, the health care infrastructure, and the roles assigned to non-state actors. Two common international strategies for HIV prevention, syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections and sexual behaviour change interventions, are examined in relation to these elements in Uganda and South Africa during the mid-to-late 1990s. During this period, Uganda's political system succeeded in promoting behaviour change interventions, while South Africa was more successful in syndromic management efforts. Interactions between the four elements of the policy environment were found to be conducive to such results. These elements are relatively static features of the socio-political environments, so lessons can be drawn for current HIV/AIDS policy, both in these two countries and for a wider audience addressing the epidemic.},
	Annote = {Notes

Four mechanisms at work here:
1. Role of leadership: Mandela and Mbeki v. Mouseveni; S.A.: consensus and inclusion prioritized, and things that potentially disrupted that were sidelined; Uganda: Museveni emphasized it and made it high on the agenda. "Nonetheless, emphasising the important of leadership is not sufficient to explain sustained outcomes.

2. Bureaucratic system: biggest difference is in the flexibility of systems. S.A.'s system developed under the apartheid regime: "These structures developed under a system of repression and and as a result were typified by inflexibility and difficulty in cooperatin with the new government" [1918]. Uganda: established a completely new political and bureaucratic apparatus, built from grassroots up.

3. Health Care infrastructure: SA has a well-developed sector, and so "was conducive to health interventions requiring standardised protocols and adequate supplies." Uganda had a much more difficult and ad hoc system, "could not easily support such interventions, instead being susceptible to independent service provision and variability in approaches on the ground."

4. Donor and NGO relations: SA; NGOs did not play a strong role in the initial AIDS policy development, and the government has been especially touchy about criticism. Also linkages to the medicalizzed pop control program of the aprtheid regime. Uganda: Much greater relation with the international NGO and IO community for both funding and projects/services. As result, there was opp for variation and experimentation.

	Abstract = {Conflict, displacement, food insecurity and poverty make affected populations more vulnerable to HIV transmission.  However, the common assumption that this vulnerability necessarily translates into more HIV infections and consequently fuels the HIV/AIDS epidemic is not supported by data.  Whether or not conflict and displacement affect HIV transmission depends upon numerous competing and interacting factors.  This paper explores and explains the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in conflict and addresses the unique characteristics that must be addressed when planning and implementing HIV/AIDS interventions among populations affected by conflict as compared with those in resource-poor settings.  These include targeting at-risk groups, protection, programming strategies, coordination and integration and monitoring and evaluation.  Areas for future HIV/AIDS operational research in conflict are discussed.

	Abstract = {The nucleotide sequence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) gp120 variable region (V3) was obtained by sequencing the product of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of seven HIV-1 Mexican isolates from patients who had been infected either sexually or through blood products. Mexican isolates showed a 61.4% homology between them and three viral subtypes were demonstrated. One of these corresponds to three sexually infected patients, another to two hemophiliac patients infected through blood products or transfusions and the third subtype to either sexually or blood infected patients. The latter shows a great similarity to the HTLV-IIIb/LAV prototype strain. Antigenic profiles of this region show at least three neutralization patterns for these isolates as well as one virus that does not have a high predictive value epitope in the V3 region. Our data show that Mexico has a high heterogeneity of HIV-1 circulating strains, similar to that reported in other regions of the world.},

	Abstract = {Early medical intervention in patients with HIV infection is beneficial even in asymptomatic individuals. Medical care in these patients consists of the use of antiretroviral drugs, drugs to prevent opportunistic infections, vaccines and comprehensive psychosocial support. It is important to determine the stage of the natural history of the disease at any given moment. Besides clinical data, the determination of CD4+ T-lymphocytes is useful to make decisions related to the institution of antiretroviral drugs and preventive therapy for opportunistic infections. Present evidence shows a clear benefit of starting antiretroviral drugs in every patient with AIDS or AIDS related complex and also supports the use of these drugs in early stages of the disease. Preventive therapy against Pneumocystis carinii has to be instituted in every patient with CD4 lymphocyte counts below 200/mm3. Prophylactic therapy may also be necessary to prevent tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis and M. avium. It is likely that future studies will show some benefit with the use of additional preventive strategies for other frequent infections such as Cytomegalovirus and Cryptosporidium.},

Currently, new pharmacologic agents and their combinations with zidovudine are being evaluated in clinical trials to determine their efficacy in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. Nevertheless, zidovudine is still the mainstay of therapy in AIDS patients. Significant findings regarding monotherapy, combination therapy, and immunotherapy for the treatment of HIV infection are also discussed. There is considerable controversy on the optimal time to initiate therapy with antiretroviral agents. The clinician's decision to initiate antiretroviral therapy should consider the expectations of patients in the context of relative benefits and potential toxicities of therapy. The clinician must be aware that rigid universal therapy guidelines for all patients may not be appropriate. Currently available drugs are only palliative and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for early intervention is indispensable on the basis of recent knowledge of the extremely complex pathogenesis of HIV infection. At present time, the medical care of AIDS patients should be individualized and done in the context of the patient-physician relationship for therapeutic and nontherapeutic decisions.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE. To describe the epidemiological profile of AIDS and malignancies in Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The study population included a group of AIDS patients seen at four National Institutes of Health and one at a general hospital in Mexico City, from 1983 to 1992. Demographic, clinical and laboratory information was obtained. RESULTS. A total of 202 patients were studied; 199 men and three women. The mean age was of 34.5 years (range 18-67 years). Kaposi's sarcoma was the most frequent malignancy, with 166 cases, followed by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with 33 cases. The three women had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, one of them associated with cervical carcinoma. Rectal cancer was present in three cases. DISCUSSION. The spectrum of AIDS-associated malignancies in Mexico is similar to that described in other populations. The early diagnosis of this complication is necessary, as well as the search for therapeutic actions to prevent severe immunosuppression and the consequent appearance of malignancies.},

	Abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) still is an important health problem in Mexico. According to reported figures, an excess in the number of cases has occurred during recent years, mainly among young adults of both sexes. The present estimated rate of TB is 51.7 cases/100,000 inhabitants. This is the most frequent endemic infection among AIDS patients, ranking third among infectious diseases after candidiasis and P. carinii pneumoniae. A total of 8.3% of the 19,352 AIDS cases notified to July 1994, presented TB as the initial manifestation. According to sentinel surveillance carried out since 1990 in 17 states, HIV seroprevalence among TB patients has been 3.1% (0-6.5%) in males and 1.0% (0-2.3%) in females. Results of epidemiologic research in the field of TB prevention and characteristics of drug sensitivity of strains of M. tuberculosis isolated from HIV/AIDS patients are also described. Finally, perspectives of TB prevention and control are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Studies on sexually transmitted diseases (STD) during the previous years in Mexico are discussed. The information sources were: a) Surveys among commercial sex workers. Since 1990, 1,386 women have been studied in four federal states through structured questionnaires and laboratory tests. Prevalence of different STD's has been significant (syphilis (VDRL, FTA-abs) 23.7%; chlamydiosis (Ag IF) 12.9%; gonorrhea (Ag, ELISA) 11.5%; anti-HBs 11.0%; herpes 1,2 (IgM) 9.3%, HBsAg 5.7%. Frequency of HIV (ELISA, Western blot) has been low; 0.5%. In 1994, 662 women were studied in Mexico City, with different laboratory techniques for chlamydiosis and gonorrhea (culture), hepatitis B (anticore antibodies) and herpes (total antibodies) with the following results: syphilis 1.5-12%; chlamydiosis 10.8-11.7%; gonorrhea 0-5.9%; hepatitis B 0-7.1%; herpes 44.7-78%; and HIV 0-1.4%. b) Surveys among men with homosexual and bisexual practices. 325 subjects have been studied in three federal states using methods similar to those of the 1990 survey. Contrasting with results among women, HIV prevalence was found to be high; (18.8%), and considerable for other STD's: anti-HBsAg 28.6%, syphilis 34.9%, recent herpes 10.9%, HBsAg 5.0%, chlamydiosis (Ag, IF) 4.3%, herpes simplex 1,2 (Ag, IF) 4.7%, gonorrhea (Ag, ELISA) 2.8%. c) Patient clinical studies. The clinical interrelationship between different STD and HIV infection has been studied; clinical differences are described between patients with condylomata or syphilis depending on HIV serostatus. Implications of the interrelationship between different STD's and HIV infection for the prevention and control of these diseases are discussed.},

	Abstract = {By December 1993, more than 17,000 AIDS cases had been reported in Mexico and some estimates indicate approximately 100,000 individuals currently infected with HIV. From the patient's perspective, being HIV positive or having AIDS, places an enormous burden on psychosocial coping mechanisms. Thus, psychosocial support is required for all of these patients. This paper summarizes our educational intervention on counseling techniques and provides information of our demonstration project on the effectiveness of the educational intervention among 89 Mexican health care workers. Overall, these professionals showed improvement in their knowledge and goals of providing counseling. One of the more striking was the discovery of homophobic attitudes among them, particularly those with no previous experience in the care of HIV infected people. This exploratory study allowed us to identify research and educational needs of health care workers. The overwhelming number of estimated cases of HIV infections and the current trends of the epidemic reveal the necessity for training in medical counseling that over 73,000 physicians in Mexico will face in the immediate future.},

	Abstract = {This study presents blood-associated AIDS epidemic trends in Mexico, including cases due to blood transfusions, cases in professional blood donors and hemophiliacs. We present also an overview of preventive measures--both legal and educative--undertaken to prevent this type of transmission and its effects on the epidemic. The first blood-associated AIDS cases in Mexico were reported in 1985, since then and up to July 1, 1994 a total of 1,728 adult cases and 116 pediatric cases have been reported (12.3% and 25% of the total cases, respectively). As in many other parts in the world, in Mexico women were markedly affected by this form of transmission; the women to men morbidity ratio is 1.35. Another group particularly affected by AIDS in Mexico are professional blood donors, who were infected because of improper management and recycling of blood transfusion centers bank materials such as plasmapheresis sets, in some blood transfusion centers in our country. Blood screening is mandatory for all blood donors in Mexico since May, 1986. A year later blood commercialization was banned because of the extremely high HIV infection prevalences found in some professional blood donors (7.2%). Since that time a whole set of preventive measures has been implemented in our country, including blood quality and safety control as well as educative interventions. Results of these measures began to become evident by the end of 1991, when newly reported blood associated AIDS cases started to decrease, as opposed to their continuous growth seen in previous years. Up to July 1, 1994 we estimate that a total of 2,750 AIDS cases have been prevented through these measures, recovering an average of 36 years of potential life for each of them. Although blood transmission preventive measures have rendered significant achievements, we still have to face some very complex challenges such as potential ruralization of the epidemic and its impact on HIV infection prevalences among potential blood donors and therefore the need to ensure blood screening in rural areas.},

	Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to describe the AIDS epidemic in rural areas of Mexico. Information from the National AIDS Registry and the 1990 XI National Census was used. Rural AIDS cases and urban cases were compared regarding notification time, sex, risk categories and migration information. Of the 19,090 AIDS cases reported to the first of July 1994, 699 (3.7%) were rural cases. The first five of these cases were reported in 1986, three years after the first cases had been reported in Mexico. The number of AIDS cases has been growing each year but in 1991. Cases have been reported by all Mexican states. The state with the highest prevalence was Nayarit with 102 cases per million inhabitants, followed by Morelos with 99, Jalisco with 90, and Colima and Tlaxcala with 84. A total of 25% of the rural cases are migrants who have been to the US, against 6.1% of cases from urban areas. The distribution by sex shows 21.3% of women affected against 14.4% of urban cases (p < 0.05). The rural female to male ratio is 1:4, while the urban ratio is 1:6. The prevalence rates are almost three times greater in men than in women. The rural AIDS pattern represents a problem not because of the number of people affected but because of the heterosexual way of transmission. We do not think that migration to the US is going to change. The rural AIDS epidemic is more recent and growing faster than that occurring in the urban setting.},

@article{izazola-licea1995a,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze HIV homosexual transmission in Mexico, epidemic trends and biological and social risk factors. METHODS: This analysis is based on 19,090 notifications of AIDS cases and on a review of two previous studies that include 3,029 behavioral interviews (together with HIV serological screening tests) carried out at the Information Center of the Mexican Council for Control and Prevention of AIDS (CONASIDA) (1988-89) and during a 1988 study in six Mexican cities. Cities were included because they were the larger in the country and/or because they were the larger in the country and/or because they were touristic places (Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Acapulco, Tijuana and Merida). Logistic regressions were used to estimate the odds ratios for HIV seropositivity and for condom use. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of the total reported AIDS cases (19,090) up to June 30, 1994, were associated with male homosexual behaviors. In absolute numbers, cases under this category exhibited a rising trend until the end of 1993. HIV seroprevalence was 31% in 2,314 men with homosexual practices who attended "FLORA", the AIDS Information Center in Mexico, from January 1988 to June 30, 1989. The main predictive variables for seropositivity were exclusive homosexual behavior, more than 40 lifetime sexual partners, mixed sexual behavior (both insertive and receptive and intercourse), sex with a person with AIDS, history of syphilis, and anal or genital warts. In general, these risk factors (data from the Information Center) are similar to those found in the six Mexican cities study. There were significant differences in HIV prevalence among the high-risk city samples (the highest in Mexico City with 25% and the lowest in Monterrey with 2.4%). Reported condom use was very low in both studies: only 5% used a condom in all of their sexual relationships. A statistically significant protective effect for HIV infection was found only for those who reported using a condom in all sexual encounters. In the six cities study, city of residence was a strong predictor of condom use. CONCLUSIONS: HIV homosexual transmission is steadily increasing; the recent decline in the percentage of homosexual cases is artificial because of the increment of cases under other categories. Men who report exclusive homosexual behavior have higher prevalence rates of infection than bisexual men. Individuals with insertive/receptive behavior (mixed) have the highest risk for HIV seropositivity, mainly because of sociological, rather than biological reasons. This difference in risks for HIV and condom use may be related to the selection of sexual partners from specific social networks. Condom use was demonstrated to be an effective method for preventing HIV seropositivity among those who always use condoms. However, it is alarming that only 5% of respondents reported condom use in all sexual encounters. Social and geographic differences in the cumulative numbers of cases, HIV prevalence, sexual practices and condom use must be taken into account in the planning of preventive programs.},

Through these studies, we have been able to find out how different issues influence commercial sex work in Mexico City. Since the beginning of our own studies in 1989, HIV prevalence in this particular group has remained low (0.04%-0.2%). Factors found to be associated with condom use were: educational level, not having children, more experience in sex work and younger age. Condom use was reported by 88% of the women; however, qualitative information and high STD prevalence rates suggest a much lower condom use. Mandatory HIV testing is not useful as a preventive measure among sex workers. Persuasive and structural interventions must be implemented in accordance with local and legal situations.},

Since 1985, when the first AIDS cases among women were reported in Mexico and until June 1, 1994, a total of 2,767 cases have been reported, representing 14.8% of the total number of cases. The first cases of AIDS among women were associated to infected blood transfusions; however, in 1986, heterosexually transmitted cases began to appear. Currently, only 35% of newly reported AIDS cases are associated to blood transfusions while 64% of them are related to heterosexual transmission. In fact, two epidemics are evident: one transmitted through blood, showing a downward trend (duplication time 45 months), and a second one, heterosexually transmitted, increasing twice as fast (duplication time 27 months). The latter is expected to dominate AIDS epidemiology among women in the future. In general, women are more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS biologically, but also socially and culturally. Women's economic, social and cultural subordination to their sexual partners results in a situation that makes it difficult for them to assess their infection risk and even more, to negotiate taking preventive measures. This situation is even more disadvantageous to rural women and, together with the recent trend of the AIDS epidemic to ruralization and with internal and international migration (temporary work force migration to the USA), can result in deep demographic and social effects. We conclude that it is necessary to work on the design and assessment of preventive measures under women's control, that empower them to protect themselves even without their partner's awareness. Also, it is necessary to promote sexual education among young heterosexual couples on how to talk about sexual issues and negotiate the use of preventive measure according to their actual sexual practices.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the experience of the Immunodeficiency Clinic of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Hospital Infantile de Mexico "Federico Gomez", in the management of children with HIV infection and AIDS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: the medical records of 130 patients with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of HIV/AIDS seen between September 1985 and June 1994 were reviewed. Data was obtained regarding diagnosis, epidemiological risk factors, clinical features, types and numbers of bacterial and opportunistic infections, malignancies, hospitalizations, general and specific treatment and outcome. The diagnosis followed CDC guidelines and was established in all 130 patients serologically with ELISA and Western Blot. In infants < 18 months, diagnosis was made by detection of p24 and/or viral culture in two separate occasions. RESULTS: Data from 130 subjects was obtained; 74 were male and 56 female for a M:F ratio of 1.3:1. With regards to mode of transmission, 62.3% was vertical, 20.8% post transfusion, 8.5% hemophiliacs (the latter two males were cases before occurred 1987), 6.2% sexual and 2.2% unknown. With regards to additional risk factors, in 35 cases the parents were heterosexual, in 18 one parent had a history of transfusion, and in eight the father was bisexual. According to the CDC classification; 16 had indeterminate infection or PO; nine were asymptomatic or P1; and 105 were symptomatic or P2. Eighty two patients had nonspecific findings, 60 had neurologic manifestations, 18 had lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia and four had secondary malignancies. It was possible to document 296 episodes of secondary infections: 154 bacterial, 58 opportunistic, and 84 with other pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: in Mexico, as in other Western countries, vertical transmission has become the dominant form of acquiring HIV infection in children, reflecting a change in the epidemiology of infection in women of child bearing age. Moreover, since IV drug use is a very limited phenomenon in Mexico, heterosexual transmission is the major form of transmission in women.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to analyze the HIV/AIDS magnitude, distribution, frequency, patterns, trends, risk factors, risk groups, estimation and evaluation of interventions in Mexico during the last twelve years. Results of a summary of statistics and results from several sources are presented including the National Registry of AIDS cases, HIV sentinel surveillance in 18 cities of the country, analysis of death certificates, cross-sectional, longitudinal, observational, and intervention studies. As of March 1995, 34,230 AIDS cases, 120,000 HIV infections and 21,000 AIDS deaths are estimated. A damaged exponential growth with duplication of AIDS cases every 18 months can be seen. Epidemiological patterns of transmission are found primarily among men with homosexual and bisexual practices. The male:female ratio is 6 to 1. In 1992 AIDS was the 19th cause of death among the general population. At least two patterns of transmission have been identified: one is the western-urban pattern which contributes with more than 90% of cases and the other, more recent, has been described as Caribbean-rural. Blood transmission of AIDS shows a downward trend, and heterosexual and perinatal transmission is slightly increasing. Seroprevalence among adults is 0.06%: however, among groups with risk practices, rates up to 50% have been found. Risk factors are similar to those described in the literature in other countries, and have been used for designing interventions. Evaluation of interventions has been accomplished by demonstrating positive results in the prevention of blood transmission and sexual transmission among female commercial sex workers; prevention efforts directed to men with homosexual practices have not been successful. Between 77,000 and 88,000 cumulated AIDS cases are estimated in Mexico for the year 2000.},

This paper presents the lessons learned, a discussion of obstacles and mistakes, and the different evaluation methods which have been used in CONASIDA'S mass media communication strategies and their results. Knowing the opinion of some clue informants was considered relevant--taking into account that evaluations were made by and at CONASIDA--and seven in-depth interviews were conducted among intellectuals, non-governmental organizations (NGO) leaders and public opinion leaders. The importance of society's involvement in AIDS prevention is stated, and two examples of mass media campaigns developed by civil groups are commented. A section about the importance of research as a requisite to produce preventive messages is included, along with some examples. Finally, some conclusions are presented, useful to us, as well as others, in developing new educational campaigns.},

	Abstract = {A set of hypotheses derived from experiential learning and a realpolitik orientation to crisis bargaining are employed to investigate the bargaining behavior of pairs of states embroiled in recurring crises. It is proposed that in crisis bargaining, experiential learning focuses on the outcome of the preceding crisis, and the lessons drawn from that experience are interpreted in accordance with a realpolitik orientation that stresses the importance of a credible demonstration of power and resolve. The hypotheses predict that in crises between states of relatively equal military capabilities, successful outcomes encourage policymakers to repeat the bargaining strategy employed in the previous crisis, while failures lead to more coercive bargaining in the next crisis. Employing events data from a sample of 18 disputes among 6 pairs of states, each pair having been engaged in three successive crises, a significant pattern of shifts to more coercive bargaining following crises with unsuccessful outcomes was found.},

@article{huber1991a,
	Abstract = {This paper differs from previous examinations of organizational learning in that it is broader in scope and more evaluative of the literatures. Four constructs related to organizational learning (knowledge acquisition, information distribution, information interpretation, and organizational memory) are articulated, and the literatures related to each are described and critiqued. The literature on knowledge acquisition is voluminous and multi-faceted, and so the knowledge acquisition construct is portrayed here as consisting of five subconstructs or subprocesses: (1) drawing on knowledge available at the organization's birth, (2) learning from experience, (3) learning by observing other organizations, (4) grafting on to itself components that possess knowledge needed but not possessed by the organization, and (5) noticing or searching for information about the organization's environment and performance. Examination of the related literatures indicates that much has been learned about learning from experience, but also that there is a lack of cumulative work and a lack of integration of work from different research groups. Similarly, much has been learned about organizational search, but there is a lack of conceptual work, and there is a lack of both cumulative work and syntheses with which to create a more mature literature. Congenital learning, vicarious learning, and grafting are information acquisition subprocesses about which relatively little has been learned. The literature concerning information distribution is rich and mature, but an aspect of information distribution that is central to an organization's benefiting from its learning, namely how units that possess information and units that need this information can find each other quickly and with a high likelihood, is unexplored. Information interpretation, as an organizational process, rather than an individual process, requires empirical work for further advancement. Organizational memory is much in...

As long as you have enough observations, you can probably handle the
extra few variables. You may run into problems if you try to interact
these polynomials with your cross-sectional unit (if, for instance,
you think these trends are different in each country or something
similar). This is because you'd need 3 polynomials terms for each
country. You can read about this in the Honaker and King paper.

That's right on the first question, more or less.

The second question is more subtle, but I think a reasonable answer is
put in as many polynomials as your data will allow. The higher order
terms won't hurt your imputations as long as the algorithm can still
run with them and they'll drop out (have a zero beta term) if they
don't provide any help in prediction.

good luck.

The paper helps.

So we're actually literally taking the year number (e.g., 2000) and
squaring or cubing it? but that then allows us to find the betas and use
them in creating the imputed values.

How does one decide what order of polynomial to include in the imputation?
What are the theoretical reasons behind the particular choice one might
make?

Thanks for your help. I know this may be beyond your purview (Esp. that
second question) as the package maintainer, so feel free to refer me on to

Hey Nathan,

The treatment of this subject is taken up in Honaker and King (2007),
which you can find here:

http://gking.harvard.edu/files/pr.pdf

The basic idea here is that we might be able to write variables as a
(noisy) function of time. Think about drawing a graph with gdp on the
y-axis and time on the x-axis. You might imagine that there would be
some curve that could track the movement of gdp through time. We can
approximate that curve using a polynomial of function of the x-axis,
time.

Thus, think of t={1960,1961,...,2000}. We're writing a function of
these numbers. If this was the only way we were predicting GDP, then
we would estimate GDP in 1970 as:

GDP_{1970} = b_0 + b_1*{1970} + b_2*{1970^2} + b_3*{1970^3}

where the b's are estimated from the Amelia algorithm. We usually
would want to include other variables as they will help us predict GDP
as well, but this is simply illustrative.

Amelia will only include up to a cubed term for you, but you could
always add the terms yourself by doing something like:

amelia.data <- cbind(data, (data$time)^2,(data$time)^3,(data$time)^4)

and then don't tell amelia to include polynomials of time. Off the top
of my head, i think that should work the same as the way amelia does
it.

hope that helps,
matt.

Matt,

Can you explain what it is the Amelia is doing when it takes polynomials of
time? Specifically, I'm interested in what occurs computationally in
refernce to a passage like this in the manual:
" Amelia
can build a general model of patterns within variables across time by
creating a sequence of polynomials of
the time index. If, for example, GDP varies smoothly over time, then we make
the modeling assumption that
there exists some polynomial that describes the economy in cross-sectional
unit i at time t as: GDP (t)i =
0 + 1 t + 1 t2 + 1 t3 . . . And thus if we include enough higher order
terms of time then the pattern between
observed values of GDP can be estimated"

What's going on with that time term there? Can Amelia only go up to cubing
the t?

Best,
-Nathan

@article{hammond2007,
	Abstract = {The formal hierarchical structures of organizations can be expected to affect the organizations' behavior in many different ways. One kind of impact is that their structures may affect how their knowledge is organized. This is important because the different ways in which knowledge can be organized may affect what the organizations' decision makers learn from the information that their organizations have gathered, stored, and processed. However, rigorous testing of this general argument would not be easy, and so it would be useful if a preliminary means of assessment could be found so that we can better judge whether a full-scale test is warranted. Hammond (1993) noted that a library catalogue is also a formal structure for hierarchically organizing knowledge, which means that different kinds of cataloguing systems represent different ways of organizing knowledge. Two different kinds of cataloguing systems --- the Library of Congress classification and the Dewey Decimal classification --- are widely used in US libraries, and Hammond conjectured that these two different cataloguing systems will tend to bring different sets of books to the attention of library users; this in turn should be expected to have consequences for what the library users can most easily learn from the library. This article tests Hammond's conjecture in two university libraries, focusing on 40 classic books in political science. The results provide strong empirical support for the conjecture: although the two cataloguing systems do not appear to organize knowledge in completely different ways, what differences they do have nonetheless appear to have a striking impact on what users can most easily learn. Support is thus provided, albeit indirectly, for the general argument that how organizations are structured hierarchically should be expected to affect what organizational decision makers are able to learn.},

	Abstract = { Whose ideas matter? And how do actors make them matter? Focusing on the strategic deployment of competing normative frameworks, that is, framing issues and grafting private agendas on policy debates, we examine the contentious politics of the contemporary international intellectual property rights regime. We compare the business victory in the establishment of the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property (TRIPS) in the World Trade Organization with the subsequent NGO campaign against enforcing TRIPS to ensure access to essential HIV/AIDS medicines. Our analysis challenges constructivist scholarship that emphasizes the distinction between various types of transnational networks based on instrumental versus normative orientations. We question the portrayal of business firms as strictly instrumental actors preoccupied with material concerns, and NGOs as motivated solely by principled, or non-material beliefs. Yet we also offer a friendly amendment to constructivism by demonstrating its applicability to the analysis of business. Treating the business and NGO networks as competing interest groups driven by their normative ideals and material concerns, we demonstrate that these networks' strategies and activities are remarkably similar. },

	Abstract = { Should the global AIDS pandemic be framed as an international security issue? Drawing on securitization theory, this article argues that there is a complex normative dilemma at the heart of recent attempts to formulate the global response to HIV/AIDS in the language of international security. Although "securitizing" the AIDS pandemic could bolster international AIDS initiatives by raising awareness and resources, the language of security simultaneously pushes responses to the disease away from civil society toward military and intelligence organizations with the power to override the civil liberties of persons living with HIV/AIDS. The security framework, moreover, brings into play a "threat-defense" logic that could undermine international efforts to address the pandemic because it makes such efforts a function of narrow national interest rather than of altruism, because it allows states to prioritize AIDS funding for their elites and armed forces who play a crucial role in maintaining security, and because portraying the illness as an overwhelming "threat" works against ongoing efforts to normalize social perceptions regarding HIV/AIDS. These overlooked dangers give rise to a profound ethical dilemma as to whether or not the global AIDS pandemic should be portrayed as a security issue. The article concludes that securitization theory cannot resolve this complex dilemma, but that raising awareness of its presence does allow policy makers, activists, and scholars to begin drawing the links between HIV/AIDS and security in ways that at least minimize some of these dangers. },

@article{shadlen2007,
	Abstract = { This article examines the relationship between intellectual property (IP) and public health, with a focus on the extension of AIDS treatment in the developing world. While most of the literature on IP and health examines the conditions affecting poor countries capacities to acquire essential medicines, I show the distinct-and more complicated-political economy of production and supply. IP regulations alter the structure of generic pharmaceutical sectors in the countries capable of supplying essential medicines, and changes in market structure affect actors economic and political interests and capacities. These new constellations of interests and capacities have profound implications for the creation and maintenance of political coalitions in support of on-going drug supply. The result is that the global AIDS treatment campaign becomes marked by mismatches of interests and capacities: those actors capable of taking the economic, legal, and political steps necessary to increase the supply and availability of essential drugs have diminished interest in doing so, and those actors with an interest in expanding treatment may lack the capacities to address the problem of undersupply. By focusing centrally on actors interests in and capacities for economic and political action, the article restores political economy to analysis of an issue-area that has been dominated by attention to international law. And by examining the fragility of the coalitions supporting the production and supply of generic drugs, the article points to the limits of transnational activist networks as enduring agents of change. },

	Abstract = {This paper present first results from a new survey on bureaucratic structure in Africa.  The aims of the survey were to gain quantitative data on incentives and structures of the African bureaucracies and to ensure comparability of the new data with existing data sets, in particular the data sets provided by Rauch and Evans (1999) and World Development Report (1997).  First we study the evidence on bureaucratic structure across Africa. We find quite large differences in structure and performance between country's in the region and also between Africa and other regions of the world. Second we incorporate the African data into the larger sample of developing countries which allows us to estimate whether meritocratic bureaucracies perform better, have lower corruption and higher efficiency in their service delivery and provide better framework for the private sector.  We find that the African countries in general are not ``a case of their own'' but are described reasonably well by the same incentive structures as other countries: Better bureaucratic performance is associated with greater power and autonomy of agencies to formulate policies, good career opportunities in the public sector, good pay of public servants and little shifting between public and private employment.},

characterized by positive sorting between workers and managers when knowledge 
acquisition takes place before production. We extend the analysis and find that 
complementarities between manager and worker skill are even stronger when 
knowledge is acquired on the job. We then examine empirically the existence of 
sorting in law firms along the dimensions of cognitive ability and experience. We 
find strong evidence of positive sorting by cognitive ability, as proxied by the quality 
of the law school attended, but little evidence of sorting by experience, suggesting 
little substitutability between cognitive ability and experience.},

Agents organize production by matching with others in knowledge hierarchies designed to use and communicatie their knowledge efficiently. Relative to autarky, organization leads to larger cross-sectional differences in knowledge and wages: low-skill workers learn and earn relatively less. We show that improvements in the technology to acquire knowledge lead to aopposite implication on wage inequality and organization than reductions in communication costs.},

	Abstract = {Data from a stratified random sample of 71 installations from nine executive departments of the U.S. government are analyzed so as to replicate and reexamine the findings of Blau and Schoenherr from state employment agencies on the relations between size and various components of complexity. Although results have some similarity, many significant differences are found, especially for relationships of personal specialization and division of labor with other variables. Generally, size is a more important predictor of complexity with the Blau and Schoenherr data, while division of labor is a more important predictor with the federal data. Two possible explanations for the differences in findings are investigated: size and technology. Comparison of analyses for small and large organizations from both studies yields no coherent patterns. Comparison of parallel analyses for routine and nonroutine federal organizations gives a pattern of significant differences that partially duplicates the differences found between the two studies. In the study of federal organizations, however, all effects of size on horizontal differentiation are indirect, being mediated by division of labor in routine organizations and by personal specialization in nonroutine organizations. Implications of the findings for Blau's deductive theory and for the understanding of causes of organizational structure are discussed.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the design of administrative procedures when policy consequences are uncertain. In general, when deciding how much discretion to delegate, legislators must trade off informational gains from agency expertise and distributive losses from bureaucratic drift. We show that when Congress has both ex post agenda control and access to information, it will delegate a large degree of discretionary authority to all agencies, regardless of differences in policy preferences. This "discretionary floor" rises as future events become more uncertain. We further show that the possibility of coalitional drift, or changing preferences of the median legislator, may lead either to "hard-wired" agencies with little discretionary authority or "soft-wired" agencies with large discretionary powers to set policy.},

As was hypothesized, relationships among the members of the groups in the more mechanistic organization were seen as more formal at all levels of the hierarchy, all groups saw themselves as having less autonomy, and the organizational climate was seen as being oriented toward rules and conventionality. Unexpectedly, however, the organizational climate was also seen as developmental, generating at group level greater involvement of managers with the group. The multidimensionality of concepts such as organizational structure and climate is noted, and the complexity of the interrelationships among the various dimensions of these two concepts is stressed.},

@article{ranson1980a,
	Abstract = {The study of organizations is rife with competing vocabularies and perspectives. Taking a specific and traditional focus - organizational structure - the authors argue for a more unified theoretical and methodological analysis that is adequate at the levels of meaning and causality. They break with the typical conception of structures as a formal framework counterposed to the interactive patterns of organizational members. Drawing upon Bourdieu and Giddens, they stress the way structures are continually produced and recreated by members so that the structures embody and become constitutive of their provinces of meaning. Such an analysis must incorporate not only relations of meaning and power but also the mediation of contingent size, technology, and environment. The creativity of members in the face of contextual constraint can only be assessed by setting the analysis in a temporal, historical dimension.},

Factor and cluster analyses yielded three independent dimensions of decentralization, specialization, and formalization. The results are interpreted to suggest not only that a multidimensional model of bureaucracy is superior to the unidimensional Weberian one, but that the dimensionality of the bureaucratic structure space may be a function of the socio-cultural environment of the organization unit being examined. The results imply that bureaucratic structure may conform to the equifinality principle, in that a variety of structural arrangements appear to be equally viable strategies for the various sample organizations.},

The model was also extended to include hierarchical levels, after vertical and horizontal measures of complexity were separated. Following an extensive review of the literature, both official and self-reported data from one type of economic organization (104 savings and loan associations in New York State) were employed to test the propositions in a profit-oriented context. While the findings demonstrate limited support for the model in this special type of economic organization (five of thirteen propositions were fully or partly supported by the analysis), a further classification and comparison of studies reviewed, according to the type of organization under study, suggests that a unified theory encompassing both economic and non-economic organizations is feasible.},

	Abstract = {This paper empirically investigates the proposition that the organization and operation of the large enterprise along "M-form" multidivisional lines favors goal pursuit and least-cost behavior more nearly associated with the neoclassical profit maximization hypothesis than a number of alternative organizational forms. Using a sample of petroleum firms during the period 1955-1973, a positive relationship between M-form structure and profitability is observed during the period in which the M-form innovation was being diffused. This relationship is no longer observed once an organizational form equilibrium is achieved. The results provide support for the "Markets and Hierarchies" paradigm, but additional studies are needed to affirm the generality of the finding.},

@periodical{friedman2007,
	Annote = {Was anybody out there checking out jobs with the U.S. post office in 2005? Do you remember when you called that 800 number to get details? Sure you do. Do you remember how the voice on the other end of the line helping you had this soft British accent with a slight African lilt? Do you know why? Because you were routed to a call center in Kenya.

So maybe you weren't looking for a job, but you had just bought a new computer. And when you turned it on, you clicked the icon for one of America's biggest Internet service providers to get broadband access. But you needed someone to talk you through getting it connected --- so you called that 800 number. The techie who helped you was also a Kenyan at that same Nairobi call center.

It's called KenCall. It is located in an abandoned avocado processing plant, and it is the largest of Kenya's blooming outsourcing call centers, with almost 300 employees and annual revenues that have grown to $3.5 million since it opened three years ago. If you're surprised it's here, so are most of its customers.

``I was actually talking to someone in America who had just given birth and she was ordering high-speed D.S.L. for her new residence --- three or four hours after the birth,'' said Nina Nyongesa, a 25-year-old KenCall supervisor and I.T. graduate of Nairobi University. ``She said to me, `Where are you?' I said, `Nairobi.' And she said, `Are you sure?' And she was really happy --- so she bought one for herself, one for her mother and one for her mother-in-law. So instead of making one sale I made three.''

KenCall is one small reason that Kenya's economy grew 6 percent last year. Yes, Kenya still has all the ills of other African states --- from AIDS to abject poverty. But Kenya also now has a democratically elected government that is learning to get out of the way of Kenya's entrepreneurs and to get them the bandwidth they need to compete globally. It's way too early to declare Kenya an economic ``African Tiger,'' but something is stirring here that bears watching --- and KenCall is emblematic of it.

The company was started by the half-English, half-Kenyan Nicholas Nesbitt, his brother Eric and his brother-in-law Stephen Liggins. Nicholas Nesbitt and Liggins had made successful careers on Wall Street. But after Kenya's democratic elections in 2002, they decided to come home and see if they could do good for their country and for themselves by taking advantage of Kenya's large pool of educated, English-speaking talent to break into the outsourcing industry.

There was one big problem. Kenya, like the rest of East Africa, was not connected to any global undersea fiber-optic cable that would give it the cheap high-speed bandwidth of the scale needed by call centers. The Internet here all came via satellite, which is more expensive to begin with and was made even more so by the fact that the Kenyan state phone company had a monopoly.

In a rare move in Africa, the Kenyan government decided to give up that monopoly and open competition for satellite-provided bandwidth --- even though it meant laying off 6,000 government workers. The competition made KenCall's business possible. The Kenyan government is now working feverishly to get connected to the global fiber-optic network, via an undersea cable, which would make bandwidth here cheap and plentiful enough for all sorts of outsourcing.

KenCall opened in late 2004, taking orders for U.S. late-night TV commercials. Its Kenyan operators sold Yellow Page ads, security alarms and mortgages. But it has since grown its business to include data-entry for one of the premier Wall Street credit-rating firms and handling service calls for global banks and insurance companies. For an economy dependent on coffee, safaris and flowers, this is a real change of pace.

``The concept of connecting to the outside world and attracting investors from the outside --- that has not been here before,'' remarked Stephen Ogunde, another KenCall supervisor.

KenCall's employees can make in a month what half of Kenya's population makes in a year: around $350. They get health care and free transportation.

Don't give up on Africa. KenCall is a reminder that with a little less government regulation, a little more democracy and a lot more bandwidth, African entrepreneurs can play this game too. ``In the old days, `landlocked' meant you didn't have a harbor,'' said Mr. Nesbitt. ``In the new days, it means you don't have fiber broadband to the rest of the world. This whole market here is just waiting for that.'' },

	Abstract = {Why have some national governments acted more aggressively to address the HIV/ 
AIDS pandemic than others? More specifically, what explains widely varied responses 
across Brazil and South Africa---two countries where one might have expected more 
similarity than difference? We argue that boundary institutions---those sets of rules 
and practices that give social and political meaning to group identities---help explain 
this puzzle. Institutions interact with other pressures to structure the dissemina- 
tion of information, the construction of risk, and priorities within society. Where 
institutions divide groups deeply, elites and ordinary citizens are less likely to feel 
vulnerable, and more likely to blame other groups, making aggresive government 
action far less likely.

@article{brown2006,
	Abstract = {Background: UNAIDS has developed the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) as a tool for national programmes to use for making national estimates and short term projections of HIV prevalence. EPP provides direct input to Spectrum, which produces incidence, deaths, and AIDS impacts.  Methods: The latest version, EPP 2005, includes substantial methodological improvements over the previous version. These include: (1) parallel, but unique, interfaces for generalised and concentrated epidemics; (2) use of maximum likelihood fitting procedures; (3) a new procedure, known as level fits, adjusting for expansion of national surveillance systems into lower prevalence sites; (4) provisions for handling turnover in at-risk populations, including the reassignment of HIV positive former members to lower risk populations; and (5) user-defined calibration to HIV prevalence levels from general population or other epidemiological surveys.  Results: Following regional training in mid 2005, this new version has been applied by many national programmes to make their end of 2005 estimates of HIV infections. UNAIDS has combined these national estimates to form the 2005 global HIV and AIDS estimates.  Conclusion: EPP 2005 is a substantial improvement over previous versions, forming a solid base for the next round of modifications. Proposed modifications for that next version are presented for the reader's information.

@unpublished{oster2006,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology for estimating HIV prevalence in Africa. I 
use mortality data based on sibling histories in the Demographic and Health Surveys to 
calculate the number of deaths from HIV, and use these data to infer prevalence in 
previous years. This methodology allows consistent estimation of prevalence rates over 
time and across regions within a country. Where it is possible to compare, I find that 
prevalence estimated based on mortality data is consistent with the prevalence from the 
testing data. The results confirm new estimates from population-based testing that 
indicate UNAIDS estimates of the extent of the epidemic are overstated. However, the 
methodology here dramatically expands the set of consistently estimated prevalence rates 
-- I present estimated prevalence over the entire course of the epidemic in nine countries, 
and prevalence by region in these countries in the recent period. The methodology also 
has potential to provide estimates of HIV prevalence for other sub-groups within Africa, 
and could be extended to calculate prevalence of other diseases elsewhere.

@techreport{usaid2000,
	Annote = {The API was developed by UNAIDS, USAID, and the Policy Project to measure programme effort in the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is designed to provide a current profile of national effort and a measure of change over time. The API was first applied to 40 countries in 2000, and a revised index was applied in 54 countries in early 2003.

Results of the 2003 round include:

    * programme effort is relatively high in the areas of political support, policies, and planning with average scores above 70% of the maximum effort
    * prevention programmes and the legal and regulatory environment are the next most highly rated components with scores between 60% and 70%
    * the human rights component received the lowest score
    * respondents reported that legal structures are in place to protect human rights but that resources and enforcement efforts are lacking
    * resource availability and mitigation effort also received low scores
    * by region, Eastern and Southern Africa has the highest overall scores
    * West and Central Africa and Asia also scored relatively high, with Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern Europe somewhat lower
    * the average score for all countries increased slightly from 56% in 2000 to 61% in 2003
    * the largest increases were for political support, resources, and care and treatment

Conclusions from the survey include:

    * all countries have some organised effort to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic
    * most countries have good policies and organisational structures in place
    * the weakest areas are in the implementation of the policies and plans
    * countries with the strongest effort, such as Brazil, Senegal, Thailand, and Uganda, all have strong political commitment and a national consensus that lead to significant effort to implement comprehensive programs},

	Abstract = {The popular press, policy officials, and academic publications increasingly warn of the negative effects on national security of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes it.  Despite these increasingly vocal pleas, however, the idea that HIV/AIDS erodes national security has not become conventional wisdom within the international relations discipline.  In this paper, we empirically test the link between HIV/AIDS and two aspects of national security, the severity of human rights abuses and civil conflict. Specifically, we examine the direct and indirect effects of adult HIV infection rates in 1999 and 2001 across 112 countries on the likelihood and intensity of state-imposed human rights violations and civil conflict.  We find that as HIV/AIDS prevalence rates increase, so too does the severity of human rights abuses and civil conflict.  HIV/AIDS has no direct impact on such abuses and civil conflict, however.  Rather, it influences national security indirectly through its 
impact on the social, political, and economic institutions of the state. },

	Abstract = {Institutional arrangements influence the type of policies that leaders pursue. We examine two institutional variables: size of the selectorate (S) - the set of people who have an institutional say in choosing leaders - and the size of the winning coalition (W) - the minimal set of people whose support the incumbent needs in order to remain in power. The larger the winning coalition, the greater the emphasis leaders place on effective public policy. When W is small, leaders focus on providing private goods to their small group of supporters at the expense of the provision of public goods. The size of the selectorate influences how hard leaders work on behalf of their supporters. The greater the size of the selectorate, the more current supporters fear exclusion from future coalitions. This induces a norm of loyalty that enables leaders to reduce their effort and still survive. As a first step towards a theory of endogenous selection of institutions, we characterize the institutional preferences of the different segments of society based on the consequences of these institutions for individual welfare. We conclude by examining the implication of the model for the tenure of leaders, public policy, economic growth, corruption, taxation and ethnic politics.},

@article{buenodemesquita1999,
	Abstract = {The authors advance a theory of the effects of political institutions on state policy. The theory explains how political institutions affect the ability of leaders to maintain themselves in office, why some political systems are more prone to policy failure than others, and why autocrats create mass political systems. The key characteristics of institutions in this theory are the sizes of a polity's selectorate and winning coalition. The authors derive hypotheses from the theory and test those hypotheses using a data set covering more than 2,700 leaders from all states in the period from 1816 to 1990. The statistical tests demonstrate that (1) large winning coalitions are associated with enhanced economic growth, (2) tenure is shortened by a large winning coalition but lengthened by a large selectorate, and (3) in the face of policy failure, leaders with a large selectorate are more likely to survive than those in systems with a large winning coalition. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of these results.},

	Abstract = {In the twenty plus years since AIDS was first identified, more than 20 million people have died of the disease, most of them in the developing world. Since 2001, the international community has become increasingly active on this issue. In June 2001, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called for the creation of a Global Fund to combat HIV/AIDS and said such a fund would require $8-12 billion annually of financing to conduct its operations. In 2002, the advanced industrialized countries pledged that they would support the fund. Activists, for their part, demanded that advanced industrialized countries contribute to the Global Fund on the basis of their share of global income. Some countries---the UK and the United States, for example---have made pledges and disbursements in keeping or exceeding their share of world income. Other countries---Japan and Germany for example---have lagged either in pledges or actual disbursements to the fund. Why are some countries more generous than others in their support of efforts to combat HIV/AIDS? This paper suggests that explanations based on state and individual self-interest provide a plausible first cut. However, they tend to downplay the normative and moral motivations of the general public and decision-makers. This paper draws on theories of strategic framing and veto powers to explain these anomalies and inadequacies. This paper emphasizes the way advocates have framed their case in moral terms and thus elicited the support of faith communities. This has mobilized political pressure and simultaneously convinced key policy gatekeepers in different national contexts that the values at stake were sufficiently important to warrant higher spending.},

Peter Baldwin's exploration of divergent approaches to the epidemic in the United States and several European nations is a springboard for a wide-ranging and sophisticated historical analysis of public health practices and policies. In addition to his comprehensive presentation of information on approaches to AIDS, Baldwin's authoritative book provides a new perspective on our most enduring political dilemma: how to reconcile individual liberty with the safety of the community.
Baldwin finds that Western democratic nations have adopted much more varied approaches to AIDS than is commonly recognized. He situates the range of responses to {AIDS} within the span of past attempts to control contagious disease and discovers the crucial role that history has played in developing these various approaches. Baldwin finds that the various tactics adopted to fight AIDS have sprung largely from those adopted against the classic epidemic diseases of the nineteenth century--especially cholera--and that they reflect the long institutional memories embodied in public health institutions.},

	Abstract = {Empirical research on the determinants of economic growth has typically
neglected the influence of religion. To fill this gap, we use international survey data on
religiosity for a broad panel of countries to investigate the effects of church attendance
and religious beliefs on economic growth. To isolate the direction of causation from
religiosity to economic performance, we use instrumental variables suggested by our
analysis of systems in which church attendance and beliefs are the dependent variables.
The instruments are dummy variables for the presence of state religion and for regulation
of the religion market, an indicator of religious pluralism, and the composition of
religions. We find that economic growth responds positively to the extent of religious
beliefs, notably those in hell and heaven, but negatively to church attendance. That is,
growth depends on the extent of believing relative to belonging. These results accord
with a perspective in which religious beliefs influence individual traits that enhance

	Abstract = {Abstract  Since the beginning of the 1980s, historical institutionalism has emerged as one of the most influential theoretical perspectives in social policy studies. Although their work is insightful, most institutionalist scholars tend to relegate policy ideas to the back of their theoretical constructions dealing with welfare state development. The objective of this paper is to show how institutionalist scholarship can pay greater attention to ideational processes without abandoning its core assumptions about the structuring impact of political institutions and policy legacies on welfare state development. If institutions truly influence policy-making, policy ideas matter in and beyond the agenda-setting process. Related to existing policy legacies, perceived problems mesh with policy alternatives grounded in a specific paradigm. When stressing the need to reform, and promoting new alternatives, policy entrepreneurs draw on existing ideological repertoires to frame these alternatives. The ability to successfully frame policy alternatives can become a decisive aspect of the policy process. A discussion of recent European and North American policy debates illustrates these claims.},

@misc{bell2003,
	Abstract = {Most existing estimates of the macroeconomic costs of AIDS, as measured by the
reduction in the growth rate of GDP, are modest. For Africa -- the continent where
the epidemic has hit the hardest -- they range between 0.3 and 1.5 per cent annually.
The reason is that these estimates are based on an underlying assumption that the main
effect of increased mortality is to relieve pressure on existing land and physical capital
so that output per head is little affected. We argue that this emphasis is misplaced and
that, with a more plausible view of how the economy functions over the long run, the
economic costs of AIDS are almost certain to be much higher. Not only does AIDS
destroy existing human capital, but by killing mostly young adults, it also weakens the
mechanism through which knowledge and abilities are transmitted from one generation
to the next; for the children of AIDS victims will be left without one or both parents to
love, raise and educate them.
To analyze this problem, we use an overlapping generations (OLG) model, in which
parents have preferences over current consumption and the (expected) human capital
attained by their children. Two family structures are analyzed: `nuclear' and `pooling',
whereby under the latter all children are cared for within an extended family. The decision
about how much to invest in education is influenced by premature adult mortality
in two ways: first, the family's lifetime income depends on the adults' health status,
and second, the expected pay-off depends on the level of premature mortality among
the children when they attain adulthood. Furthermore, if one or both parents die while
their offspring are still children, the transmission of knowledge across generations is
weakened.
The outbreak of AIDS leads to an increase in premature adult mortality, and if the
prevalence of the disease becomes sufficiently high, there may be a progressive collapse
of human capital and productivity. The policy problem, therefore, is to avoid such
a collapse. The instruments available for this purpose are (i) spending on measures
to contain the disease and treat the infected, (ii) aiding orphans, in the form of either
income-support or subsidies contingent on school attendance, and (iii) taxes to finance
these expenditures.
When calibrated to South Africa, the model yields the following results. In the absence
of AIDS, the counterfactual benchmark, there is modest growth, with universal
and complete education attained within three generations. If nothing is done to combat
the epidemic, however, a complete economic collapse will occur within three generations.
With optimal spending on combating the disease, and if there is pooling, growth
is maintained, albeit at a somewhat slower rate than in the benchmark case in the absence
of AIDS. If pooling breaks down, and is replaced by nuclear families, growth will
be slower still. Indeed, if school-attendance subsidies are not possible, growth will be
distinctly sluggish. In all three cases, the additional fiscal burden of intervention will
be large, which reinforces the gravity of the findings. Sensitivity analysis suggests that
these findings are robust to changes in a variety of key assumptions and parameter values
concerning mortality, the efficiency of measures taken to combat it, and the formation
of expectations. A delay in responding to the outbreak of the epidemic, however, can
lead to a collapse.},

	Abstract = {Why did the Soviet Union use less force to preserve the Soviet empire from 1989 to 1991 than it had used in distant and impoverished Angola in 1975? This book fills a key gap in international relations theories by examining how actors' preferences and causal conceptions change as they learn from their experiences.Andrew Bennett draws on interviews and declassified Politburo documents as well as numerous public statements to establish the views of Soviet and Russian officials. He argues that Soviet leaders drew lessons from their apparent successes in Vietnam and elsewhere in the 1970s that made them more interventionist. Then, as casualties in Afghanistan mounted in the 1980s, Soviet leaders learned different lessons that led them to withdraw from regional conflicts and even to abstain from the use of force as the Soviet empire dissolved. The loss of this empire led to exaggerated fears of domino effects within Russia and a resurgence of interventionist views, culminating in the Russian invasion of Chechnya in 1994. Throughout this process, Soviet and Russian leaders and policy experts were divided into competing schools of thought as much by the information to which they were exposed as by their apparent material interests. This helps explain how Gorbachev and other new thinkers were able to prevail over the powerful military-party-industrial complex that had dominated Soviet politics since Stalin's time.},

	Abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a growing interest among scholars of international relations, and global environmental governance in particular, in the role of transnational networks within the international arena. While the existence and potential significance of such networks has been documented, many questions concerning the nature of governance conducted by such networks and their impact remain. We contribute to these debates by examining how such networks are created and maintained and the extent to which they can foster policy learning and change. We focus on the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) program, a network of some 550 local governments concerned with promoting local initiatives for the mitigation of climate change. It is frequently asserted that the importance of such networks lies in their ability to exchange knowledge and information, and to forge norms about the nature and terms of particular issues. However, we find that those local governments most effectively engaged with the network are mobilized more by the financial and political resources it offers, and the legitimacy conferred to particular norms about climate protection, than by access to information. Moreover, processes of policy learning within the CCP program take place in discursive struggles as different actors seek legitimacy for their interpretations of what local climate protection policies should mean. In conclusion, we reflect upon the implications of these findings for understanding the role of transnational networks in global environmental governance.},

In  Epidemics Laid Low  epidemiologist and historian Patrice Bourdelais analyzes the history of disease epidemics in Europe from the Middle Ages to the present.

This captivating account describes how populations respond to crises of disease and how authorities deal with the devastation afterward. Bourdelais discusses the successes of northern European countries in fighting and controlling infectious diseases and emphasizes, by comparison, the failures of the countries in the south. He links success to several factors: ideology of progress, economic development, popular demands to improve public health, and investment in medical research. Bourdelais studies the social consequences of these policies, the changes in the representation of epidemics, the behaviors of populations, and heightened tensions between advocates of individual freedom and those of collective interest.

Epidemics continue to threaten us today. What do our responses to these threats say about our priorities? Will the security of public health remain a privilege of a few powerful countries or will poorer countries benefit from the efforts of the rich to prevent the spread of disease inside their own borders?},

@article{buzan1984,
	Abstract = {This article compares the merits of three concepts -- peace, power and security -- as approaches to the study of International Relations. It argues that peace and power offer only partial, and significantly flawed, views, and yet that thinking within the field has become locked into an excessively polarised framework which is dominated by the opposition between them. The necessity for a new framework arises from the intellectual exhaustion and restrictiveness of this prevailing orthodoxy. Security is put forward as an alternative framework which is capable of encompassing most of what is useful from the other two, plus much of the middle ground that is obscured by them. The argument proceeds by comparing the quality of insight which each of the three concepts offers into two of the most fundamental elements in international relations: 'the anarchy' and 'the arms race'. The case is made that each of these elements consitutes a highly durable feature of international relations, but not that is either immutable within its form, or necessarily malign in its effect. Power and peace are seen to give only narrow and incomplete views of the anarchy and the arms race. Both result in excessively rigid and negative interpretations, with power leading to an over-emphasis on the inflexibility of both elements, and peace leading to over-optimism about their removability. Security is seen to offer a more balanced perspective. It takes into account the durability of the anarchy and the arms race, but does not lead to necessarily negative views of them. It opens up the considerable scope for positive change which exists within the two elements, and so provides the basis for a synthesis of realist-idealism.},

He analyses post-Cold War, post-East-West power relations and traces the consequences of changed relationships between the great powers of the North (or 'centre') for states in the South (or 'periphery'). The centre is now more dominant, he argues, and the periphery more subordinate to it than at any time since decolonization began. In that sense, Western capitalism has triumphed over both communism and Third World ideology. Among the possibilities he outlines are the development of a civilizational 'cold war' between North and South in the coming decades as Islam is pushed to the front rank of opposition to Western hegemony; continued militarization in the South; and, as decolonization recedes into the distant past, an assault on post-colonial boundaries there, as we saw in the Gulf crisis. Societal concerns, he writes, are likely to assume a prominence on the security agenda that they have not held since before the establishment of the modern European states system.},

of knowledge. It shows that a knowledge-based hierarchy is
a natural way to organize the acquisition of knowledge when matching
problems with those who know how to solve them is costly. In such
an organization, production workers acquire knowledge about the
most common or easiest problems confronted, and specialized problem
solvers deal with the more exceptional or harder problems. The
paper shows that the model is consistent with stylized facts in the
theory of organizations and uses it to analyze the impact of changes
in production and information technology on organizational design.},

A conventional model of social learning is found to fit some types of changes in policy well but not the movement from Keynesian to monetarist modes of policymaking. In cases of paradigm shift, policy responds to a wider social debate bound up with electoral competition that demands a reformulation of traditional conceptions of state-society relations.},

	Abstract = {A programme of research on learning in international relations began developing in the 1980s. However, learning research has not realised its potential. This article seeks to stimulate new work on learning by analysing why learning is important in international relations and outlining a research focus that reflects this assessment of learning's significance. The research so far has mostly treated learning as a foreign policy phenomenon, but this fails to capture one of the major reasons for interest in learning. Learning matters in part because of long-standing debates about whether it is possible to make progress in reducing the amount of armed conflict in world politics. For such progress to occur, it is likely that some form of learning would have to take place. However, learning by just a single state will often not be sufficient to change the quality of international outcomes. There thus needs to be research specifically on the possibility of shared learning by two or more states, a research focus this article will label `international learning'. A few illustrative examples will demonstrate the feasibility of doing research on shared, cross-national learning.},

Attempts to broaden and deepen the scope of the field beyond its traditional focus on states and military conflict have raised fundamental theoretical and practical issues. Yet, adherents to the prevailing neorealist approach to security studies have often reacted to these challenges in ways that preclude a recognition of the issues raised by alternative understandings. An examination of the debates over rethinking security in particular reveals an unfortunate tendency to foreclose debate between scholars taking critical and neorealist approaches. Coming to terms more fully with the foundations of these debates allows both a better view of the positions within the field and a clearer assessment of their relevance for understanding the dynamics of contemporary security.},

	Abstract = {    The connection between domestic politics and international cooperation, specifically the relationship between regime type and alliance behavior, is examined to test two central hypotheses: democracies are more likely to ally with each other, and states of any similar regime type are more likely to ally with each other. These hypotheses emerge from three theories: constructivism, economic interdependence, and credible commitments. The authors use a data set of all pairs of states from 1816 to 1992. Results show that states with similar regime type are more likely to ally with each other after 1945, although two democracies are not more likely to ally than two autocracies during this period, and distance, learning, threat, and common culture affect alliance behavior, but trade does not. Results indicate sharp limits to the connection between democracy and international cooperation.},

	Abstract = {Organizational learning is conceived apart from inertia by drawing from the literature on organizations and cognitive psychology. Organizational learning is predicted to be cumulative and specific (limited in space and time) rather than noncumulative or general (applied to diverse subjects and new tasks). It is also expected to reflect important subject and learner characteristics that are expressed in two competing models: the first assumes that subject difficulty impedes learning and the second assumes that apparent inhibitors actually facilitate learning. Correlations are examined among successive estimates of foreign military spending, for the same countries and years, published by the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). Learning scores, for different nations, are regressed on potential learning inhibitors and facilitators that are linked to the two models. Learning in ACDA is most convincingly shown to be specific (though cumulative and noncumulative). Learning appears to occur with moderate challenges and to be determined primarily by learner characteristics.},

	Abstract = {The article analyses the impact of historical experiences on practical politics and policy making by political leaders. Although one can enhance his understanding of world politics by incorporating historical learning into models of foreign policy decision making, he must first deal with some important conceptual and methodological problems. Recent research on learning explicitly builds on theoretical concepts and analytical techniques from other disciplines. Some have applied cognitive scripts and heuristics from social psychology to examine the role of analogical reasoning in decision making through both artificial intelligence models and case study methods. Although these studies provide additional reason to believe that learning plays an important role in the formulation of foreign policy, we need to address several important analytical problems before we can make further progress in the theoretical construction and empirical testing of models of learning. In this article the author draws on the theoretical insights of learning-related research on international political economy, institutions, and epistemic communities and also draw on comparative politics and organizational theory, most of his applications are in the area of international security.},

@unpublished{lieberman2005,
	Abstract = {Within the span of a decade, the HIV/AIDS pandemic swept the African continent, making already tragic human conditions even worse. The severity of this contagious disease, and the shared international policy pressures it engendered, created a natural experiment for investigating the political and other determinants of policy responses. Subject to similar challenges, why have polities responded in different ways? In this paper, I investigate the impact of ethnic politics on policy. I propose a theory which specifies the influence of ethnicity on assessments of risk of contagion, with consequences for the political costs of government (in)action. Using two different measures of policy aggressiveness, I find through cross-country regression analyses that politically relevant ethnic diversity negatively influences government responsiveness to HIV/AIDS. This is particularly tragic for sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic is most severe, and where ethnicity is often a central component of political life. Nonetheless, as a discussion of the statistically outlying case of Uganda demonstrates, ethnicity is not destiny.

@misc{mccleary2003,
	Abstract = {Two important theories of religiosity are the secularization hypothesis and the religionmarket
model. According to the former theory, economic development reduces religious
participation and beliefs. According to the latter theory, religiosity depends on the presence of a
state religion, regulation of the religion market, suppression of organized religion under
Communism, and the degree of religious pluralism. We assess the theories by using survey
information for 61 countries over the last 20 years on church attendance and religious beliefs. In
accordance with the secularization view, overall economic development---represented by per
capita GDP---tends to reduce religiosity. Moreover, instrumental estimates suggest that this link
reflects causation from economic development to religiosity, rather than the reverse. The
presence of an official state religion tends to increase religiosity, probably because of the
subsidies that flow to organized religion. However, in accordance with the religion-market
model, religiosity falls with government regulation of the religion market, Communist
suppression, and a reduction in religious pluralism. Although religiosity declines overall with
economic development, the nature of the interaction varies with the dimension of development.
For example, religiosity is positively related to education and the presence of children and
negatively related to urbanization.},

	Abstract = {    The concepts of regimes and learning have been developed in the Liberal theory of international relations, but their application has been mostly in the area of international political economy. U.S.-Soviet relations are generally explained solely in terms of Realist theory. The dichotomy is unfortunate because both strands of theory have something to contribute. Although the injunctions of an overall regime do not govern the U.S.-Soviet security relationship, it is possible to identify the injunctions and constraining effects of regimes in subissues of the security relationship. In five areas of the nuclear relationship (destructive power, control problems, proliferation, arms race stability, and deterrent force structure), it is possible to identify different degrees of learning and to see how such learning affects and is affected by the development of regimes. Looking at the U.S.-Soviet security relationship in terms of learning and regimes raises new questions and opens a research agenda which helps us to think more broadly about the processes of political change in this area.},

@article{poteete2003,
	Abstract = {Recent work in international studies and comparative politics scrutinizes the relative importance of ideas, interests, and institutions as sources of policy change. A growing body of scholarship identifies ideas as the main causal factors, influencing perceived interests as well as perceived policy options. Others contend that policies can best be understood as products of institutions. Neither explanation can account for both policy choice by politicians and the implementation strategies of administrators. In Botswana, the use of professional criteria for hiring and advancement encourages adherence to international professional norms within the bureaucracy, but electoral competition gives politicians more reason to be attentive to local political concerns. The institutions that define relations of authority among actors with different motivations shape the outcomes of policy choice and implementation. Institutions influence the attentiveness of policy-makers to ideas when making decisions, the degree of attention particular policy-makers give to ideas from particular sources, and the degree of acceptance that ideas must achieve to affect policy. Better evaluations of political development can be achieved through attentiveness to the mix of actors involved in policy decisions, the diversity of institutions and ideas that affect their policy preferences, and the relations of authority that shape their relative influence over policy choice and implementation.},

@article{reiter1994,
	Abstract = {    This article presents and tests a theory of learning in international politics. Drawing primarily from social psychology and organization theory, the learning theory proposes that lessons tend to be drawn only from high-impact events in world politics, such as large wars and economic depressions. Lessons drawn tend to be simple and are oriented around the question of which policies are likely to be successful and which policies are likely to fail. This learning theory is tested on the alliance choices of small powers in the twentieth century. The predictions of two learning hypotheses are compared with those of a leading realist explanation of alliance choices, balance of threat theory. Quantitative analysis of small powers' alliance choices reveals that a small power's experience in the previous world war is a very powerful explanation of its peacetime alliance choices after that war, whereas the level of threat in the international environment has only marginal effects on the small power's alliance choices. Further, these threat effects may be in the opposite direction of that predicted by balance of threat theory.},
